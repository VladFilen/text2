                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">After that heavenly day with her beloved fiance, Ochi&#225;asim&#233;nia invited Aniyah to an early honeymoon. She wanted to travel far from Illithia and Anyasse, and far from their usual bounty hunting and official work, to a place that she rarely has been, to a place where her beloved Yuan-ti comes from,  Shinou. She was not sure if it was a good idea at first, but thanks to her agent in Shinou,  She is sure that the journey will be safe.

After a week of preparation, the knight would welcome once again her princess on her ship, which was stopping by the al-Najmar harbor. It&#39;s a similar ship that the couple used on their way back from Winterholems. But from the point of view of the young yuan-ti, the ship had some changes, further flags were added to the ship, and male crew, who seem to share a similar tongue to the female crow.  During her days with Ochi, Aniyah had a chance to learn some of the Illithian language. The knight wasn&#39;t the best teacher that someone could have, but she hopes that Aniyah enjoyed the lessons.

&quot;Lady Aniyah, are you ready for our trip?&quot;

The knight said while holding the woman&#39;s hand and guiding her to the main deck of the ship. She would be dressed with her old armor, which it seems like was abandoned for a while, and her lily eye patch that seems like it grows from the last time covering nearly her half eye. Ochi would let her left eyes sneak peek over her beloved hand to see if the ring was still there, and draw some smile on her face.  

&quot;For my part, I can&#39;t wait to get there, fresh up with some exotic air and smells... Maybe it would be nostalgic for you&quot; 

She would stop for a moment in the middle of the stairs

&quot;Oh, are your snake and our rocky baby with you?&quot;</span>

They had spoken of her learning more of her past before and possibly visiting Shinou in the past, but she hadn&#39;t expected it to be more than idle talk till now. She dressed in her kimono, though she had brought her Illithyian clothes her love had bought for her as well. The old outfit just felt more comfortable than the outfits that would show off much of her scales.</em>

<em>She noticed with great curiosity that the typically woman bound ship now had new members of crew, a surprising addition as she learned of Illithyian culture. She looked around with her eyes full of curiosity before looking to Ochi for answers, not really knowing what to ask.</em>

&quot;I am nervous, but excited. It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve been outside of Anyasse or Illithyia. Even the jobs I take haven&#39;t been that far away... I see there is a bit more diversity around this ship.&quot;

<em>She kept hold of her loves hand tightly as she was lead aboard, the ring on her finger as it had been since she had recieved it. It felt rather odd for everything to be changing at once and made her nervous, clinging to Ochi as the familiar factor in her life right now. In her other arm was the little homunculus cube they cared for as if it were their child.</em>

&quot;I haven&#39;t been there in a very long time. I am nervous. Don&#39;t worry, they&#39;re both here.&quot;</span>

Ochi would bright her face with a little smile, and kept leading the little family toward a couch set up under sunshade. The couch was between the captain&#39;s cabinet and the wheel of the ship. And from the wheel, one can see a drum below, which may be used to motivate the crow.

After the couple took their place Ochi&#39;s cousin would join them with some papers in her hand.

&quot;Greetings Captain!&quot; then she turns toward Aniyah  &quot;greetings lady Aniyah! Always glad to see you in our company. I hope you will enjoy your travel with us&quot;

After she greeted her cousin&#39;s fiance she would turn toward her captain &quot;Captain, there are the embarkation papers. And believe that you informed that sons of Sons of Hephaestus will join us today&quot;
&quot;Yes, Major Silveraxe informed me but that&quot;
Penelope would slightly lower her gaze.
&quot;Anything else? Officer&quot;
&quot;Everything is alright, Sir!&quot;
&quot;Okey, start sailing if everything is ready&quot;
&quot;Yes, Sir&quot;
&quot;Also, inform the drummer that will be leading the shanty today, I feel in a good mood to sing&quot;
&quot;Yes, Sir&quot;
&quot;You can go&quot;</span>

Penelope would nod and join the others to end the preparations. The Captain would take a look at the paper. &quot;everything is fine&quot; then she turns her face to her future wife.
&quot;Sorry, my love. It seems that I still had some work to deal with, but now I&#39;m all yours. And I&#39;m planning everything to make your trip as comfortable as possible.&quot; She would take her right hand, kiss it then start to caress it with other hands. &quot;I read some questions in your eyes earlier, and one of them is related to what we call Sons of Hephaestus. our society is somehow complex...And one of the fruits of this complexity is an auxiliary force composed only by men born from lagne&#237;an mothers, who decided to serve their motherland... as you know, I was born on this island and my house is from there, and this island is known for their discrimination toward men. instead of sending back those kids to their fathers, plo&#237;on adopted them&quot;</span>

&quot;When we first met, you said you had pet snakes. Are they here as well?&quot;

<em>Her curiosity was halted when her attention moved to Penelope, nodding politely as she was addressed. She noticed that Penelope would look away at the mention of what could be assumed was the men aboard, finding it curious as she tried to assess what the girl was feeling. She idly followed the conversation until the woman was dismissed, surprisingly unused to those she surrounded herself with being so in command.</em>

&quot;I see. So that is why there are men on the crew this time I suppose? There are still many things I do not understand about Illithyia. I am quite comfortable as long as I remain next to you. Much has been changing and it has been... quite a time taking it all in. What are our plans once we arrive, if I may ask?&quot;</span>

Indeed Ochi mentioned a snake pet she had on the first day they met, which Aniyah doesn&#39;t know, since the snake is not a travel-friendly little one.

&quot;Oh, Viol&#233;ta!&quot; she would ponder with her other hand &quot;To be honest, I didn&#39;t see her for a while... She is not sea travel, at least my ship is not equipped to travel with her... but you will meet her soon&quot; She would make a little smirk &quot;She is not a simple girl, she is a big anaconda, I got her a pet on my fifteenth birthday. some family brought her from the jungles in the south as an egg... And she really got along with my family members&quot;

After that Penelope left the couple to take care of the travel preparation. the ship starts leaving the harbor in the direction of the sea. It seems that the wind is great, coming from the south heading to the north. It seems that the departure is going as planned. Aniyah could hear Ochi&#39;s heart beating fast,and  existed.

&quot;You will learn everything with time, My love, no reason for the rush&quot; She would keep brushing Yuanti hair offering her hand to the snakes if they felt like clamping the Knight&#39;s shoulder.

 &quot;For our plan, first, we will stop at the nearest Island to Shinou, to get a validation paper to step in their lands. having some dinner. After the papers are ready, we will visit some village in the south that has a great water source...&quot; She would pause for a moment and put her finger on her lips &quot;That&#39;s what I can tell you, for now, I don&#39;t want to spoil the surprises&quot;</span>

&quot;You are excited yes? I just worry I may do something wrong. Others of our kin don&#39;t seem to show much emotion if any and I&#39;m not truly aware what is even normal for us. On top of that, I hardly know my own past so what could I even say? I may just be looking too far at the future, but I do have concerns.&quot;</span>

Ochi could easily feel the gentle weight of her fiance leaning on her, she would give a gentle kiss on her forehead. The Yuan-ti fell on the road to heaven. She would wonder if Aniyah still remembers her birthday, a day that she could celebrate.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry my love, everything will be alright, you are under my protection, and I will protect you with my life&quot; She would make a smile to comfort her &quot;And yes I&#39;m excited like I said I never went there, but my sister told me that it was beautiful&quot; She would ponder for a moment &quot;I believe I never spoke about her, her name is Ouran. Even though we look the same, she is more beautiful than me, but she is behaving like a Yuan-ti during her diplomatic meeting&quot; She would giggle &quot;My mothers are the strict opposite, one is a loveable social butterfly and the other...

Oku lazed over her loves shoulders a bit, still at a ready in case he was needed. She let out a soft giggle at her ever-ready friend, knowing she didn&#39;t want to put him in any danger anymore. Tariq had brought up a good point about if she lost him even for a little while, she would be sad and miss him.</em>

<em>The sweet kiss to her forehead made her smile wider and scoot closer into the cuddle. It was a nice moment for them all and she felt safe, like nothing could change it.</em>

&quot;You mentioned you have a false twin. You didn&#39;t tell me much about her though other than she&#39;s like your carrier mother. Don&#39;t lie to me, love. You&#39;re the most beautiful woman I&#39;ll ever know. I would be lying if a said I did not have some nervousness about eventually meeting more of your family.&quot;

<em>She added the small flirt in there, well set up by her love&#39;s words. A smirk appeared on her face as she looked up at Ochi, cuddling into her side like when they had finished their first time together.</em></span>

After all, her house focuses more on the family after all. The knight would keep caressing her lover with silky hair. Wondering if her next question is an appropriate one, but Ochi is still eager to know more Aniyah people. She would lower her hand toward Aniyah&#39;s arm and stroke it gently while resting her head gently on her lover&#39;s head.  

&quot;You told me before about your sibling, may I know their name? If you accept, I would like to make a memorial of them in our house in Sofia and why not send some of my people to investigate if they are blessed with life again.&quot; The reason for asking that is... to know more about her love if more things could make her happy, or make her upset. After all, the couple needs to share what their heart and mind are filled with.  

After leaving the Anyassian shore for a couple of miles, soft dum tapping could be heard coming from the lower level of the ship. Then a cappella of humming followed up.

&quot;Babe, do you feel like singing, today I would like to take the singing lead during this travel to make a little spectacle for you&quot;
After taking her lover&#39;s permission, the knight would remove their are and head slowly. She would stand up at a leisurely pace, to not scare the snakes who start to cuddle around, but she felt like keeping the rocky one with her, to pet him while walking around the ship. she would stand up on the ship balustrade in front of the driving wheel, and start singing in a melancholy but happy voice still.</span>

<em>She was conflicted about if she could handle knowing that her family may have really been out there this entire time. There was also the issue of how they would even feel if they weren&#39;t put together even as much as her. She still had pieces missing herself and was unsure of what state they would be in. She nodded an affirmation to wanting to hear her love sing, smiling once again now that the subject was mostly changed. She would follow a step behind Ochi as she stood at the balustrade, singing quietly as to not interrupt. It was a song she had learned in her side studies, wanting Ochi to believe she was good at teaching her the language. Songs had been one thing she had noticed Ochi liked so she took the time to research more.</em></span>

She would reply with another kiss on the forehead to comfort her little woman. &quot;I will help you to bring your memory back and for the memorial, we can make it ourselves, together

Back to the singing, Ochi seems to enjoy seeing her fiance joining her and singing with her, she would grab the woman and give her a hug from the back. then continue chanting, making sure to not hurt her love ears, even if her singing sounds are correct, but she somehow load so everyone in the ship could hear her easily.

&quot;Our sailing ship, Is for the hard and the quick, We roll our load and go, There&#39;s a living, to be made, Or there&#39;s Hell to pay, When you&#39;re sleeping in the cold below&quot;

The crow would with same verses

&quot;Oh Sisters you So wise and true, When it&#39;s my time to go, Won&#39;t you lay me down, Under Granum Crowns, And I&#39;ll be sleeping in the cold below&quot;

The crow would keep silent for a while before playing to her. Then Ochi would finish her song with another blue note.

&quot;Today we sail On the Solar Rail, For there&#39;s much we just don&#39;t know, So farewell with a kiss&quot; She would give a quick forehead kiss then continue &quot;Then it&#39;s fast for the mist Till we&#39;re sleeping in the cold below&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Thank you, my dear&quot;

After the end of the song, every person on the surface starts to cheer, they seem to be enjoying the chant. It&#39;s not always the knight who joins a chant, it seems too human of her taste, but today she was simply happy. After all, she has next to her the greatest gift the gods ever offered to her, and she is thankful for it. She would look at the crowd, with a grin and a bright face. She earned the spotlight, and she took advantage of it to make a little speech.

 &quot;Sisters and Brothers! I&#39;m glad to have you with us today on my first journey to Shinou. Besides the commercial and logistics purposes of it, it&#39;s an occasion for me to get my first vacancy for ages. Today I didn&#39;t come alone... I came with the new member of my house and to my family. My fianc&#233;. Tonight I want you to celebrate in her honor, but don&#39;t drink much we still have a couple of days of travel.&quot;

Another cheering scream coming from the crow. Ochi would stay for a while enjoying the praise before she takes her beloved Yuan-ti&#39;s hand and escorts her to her seat to enjoy their rest and the first day of travel toward Shinou. After letting Aniyah sit first, she would sit next to her, holding the rocky snake, who seemed confused but relaxed.

The sun is setting down slowly, announcing the end of the first day of the trip and the beginning of the first night.</span>

<em>The cheering screams and praise made her a bit uneasy as Oku made his way back to her shoulders, trying to ease her mind in the moment. She let Ochi lead her back to the seat, cuddling back into her side when she sits back down. The rocky snake looked up at them curious but complacent in the moment.</em>

&quot;We still haven&#39;t named the little one. What are your thoughts, love?&quot;

<em>She watched the setting sun with a soft sigh, feeling many emotions twisting inside her. It was hard to think that she was going back there, back home, after so long even just to visit.

Ochi would ponder thinking of a name for the rocky one, she was busy to think of any, but she had ideas. Oku has a Shinouan sounding name. So Ochi was more leaning toward giving it an Illithian name, but after thinking, she finds out it would be more interesting to find a common name between Illithian and Anyassian name, after all, it was found there.  

&quot;What do you think of Drachma? it means silver coin... or Asimi it means silver.&quot; She would be toward the rocky one to see its reaction toward both name&#39;s ideas.
&quot;After all he has a silver/gray color&quot; She would turn her head to her lover to see her opinion.

During the sunset, Penelope would come back again. she would give a small bow to the couple. 
&quot;Madam ?! Do you wish to have your dinner here on the surface or Your Room&quot;
&quot;For the first night, here on the surface, and for the rest of the upcoming evening in my room.&quot; She marked a pause &quot;unless there is a switch of the weather&quot;
&quot;Our woman sitting in the crow&#39;s nest expected some mist&quot;
&quot;Alright then&quot; She would turn her gaze toward Aniyah &quot;Darling shall we continue our evening in the captain&#39;s room?&quot;

Indeed some gray clouds start to join the ship, it will not be a hard task for the crew to manage the situation if it starts to rain heavily, but it could make the travel unpleasant. She would look at her partner while giving her a hand to help her to stand up, so she can lead her to the room where they would pass the rest of the evening.</span>

&quot;I like Asimi. It&#39;s is a good name for our little rocky baby.&quot;

&quot;It may be best we save a sunset meal for better weather. I dont believe we would like to potentially be rained on while we eat. Besides, we also need to make sure Asimi and Oku are comfortable&quot;

It seems that her lover agreed that it&#39;s better to change their place for this evening. Actually, Ochi never had the habit to stay out for long outside on top of the ship, she would rather hang out with her map, and her second of command be in charge of everything outside, but now that Ochi wanted to keep an eye for a while, supervising the crow member doing their job.

&quot; Alright then, we will dine inside... Also&quot;  she would look at Ochi knowing her condition that she can&#39;t eat neither drink... but she enjoys her tea &quot;We will eat light tonight, Wine and food for me and Jasmine tea for Aniyah... And Pen, you are welcome to join&quot;  She would give a head pat to Aniyah ``After all we are family, and I would like you to present you well,&quot; She said in a friendly tone. Before she heads to her cabinet with her Fiance.

Penelope blushed at Ochi&#39;s invitation, It seems hearing being called family made her happy. Even though she looks like a Yuan-ti in the way she talks and replies, she is still a human. The young girl would give a nod and head directly to the kitchen and ship kitchen to get the command done and supervise the operation. because the chef is not allowed to use real fire, She cooks everything using his magic.

Back in the cabinet, Ochi would help Aniyah to install on one of the sofas and sit next to her. &quot;Hope you don&#39;t mind inviting my cousin over, I assume you will be interested to learn more about her.&quot; She would draw a comforting smile on her face.</span>

&quot;I don&#39;t mind at all. She is the only one of your family that I&#39;ve met and I would indeed like to get to know her. I hope to learn more of your family as well.&quot;

<em>She looked up at Ochi with a soft smile, love plain in her other features. It wasn&#39;t often she freely showed emotion but it seemed appropriate with her love.</em></span>

&quot;Your tea, Captain Psevdoker&#225;stes, and Lady Aniyah&quot;
Ochi would give a nod of approval to serve the plates on the table.  It was mainly dry cookies with a different flavor. they were not something fancy but they were made to resist travel and avoid spoiling. For the water to make the tea still a mystery, especially if it was handled by a trusted caster.

Ochi would thank both of the women, the crew member dismissed with a word from Ochi&#39;s cousin. who kept her head lowered after the sailor left. She seems to feel awkward, clearly that she shared a formal relationship with Ochi.
&quot;Pen!&quot;  Ochi said, bringing back the woman&#39;s attention, which she raised her head toward the knight.  Ochi give her sing and said &quot;Please get comfortable, you have the right to speak freely&quot;
Penelope would make a wide smile and sit next to Aniyah.

[dragonic] &quot;Nice to meet you again, Lady Aniyah, It&#39;s always a pleasure to see you with us... I can admit that Lady Ochi&#225;asim&#233;nia have a great choice well her new partner&quot;

Ochi would raise an eyebrow when she heard her real name and sight &quot;I forgot sometimes that you know my name and can speak my language&quot; Ochi would stand up and take a look over the pot and start to serve the tea to the two women and herself&quot;</span>

A polite bow of her head was given as thanks for the tea. She found it rather odd that the girl would feel so awkward around someone she looked up to even in a formal capacity.</em>

<em>She sat up as the girl sat next to her, keeping a light hand on Ochi&#39;s knee. A soft smile was given to the newly happy girl, glad that Ochi was going to let her speak freely.</em>

&quot;It is always pleasant to see you as well, Penelope. I trust you have been well?... You flatter me.&quot;

<em>She tucked her head with a soft blush crossing her cheeks at the complement, unsure of how she should react to everyone saying she seemed like a good partner. Some of her own insecurities were still running through her mind, though she didn&#39;t let them show. She smiled, happily accepting the tea when offered. Feeling the girl&#39;s eyes on her was slightly unnerving, being unused to the attention but understanding the girls fascination with their kind.</em>

&quot;Thank you, Ochi... It is... alright. There&#39;s no need to apologize. She spoke very fondly of you upon even our first meeting... Oh love. You deserve plenty of praise.&quot; <em>She would smile up at Ochi before turning back to Penelope.</em> &quot;I would like to know more about you. You&#39;re the only one of Ochi&#39;s relatives that I have met after all. Please. Speak to your hearts content.&quot;</span>

She doesn&#39;t feel alright when she gets complimented for the work she does. It&#39;s her duty to serve her house and her nation and this is what she lives for. What she used to live for before she met Aniyah who became an important part of her life. But for her future wife&#39;s beautiful eyes she would accept her cousin&#39;s compliment and try to enjoy it. She would extend her hand to her cousin&#39;s head and pet it.

&quot;Thank you, Pen, also you do a good job on the ship&quot;

Penelope would blush to hear her cousin&#39;s words, she was more than happy to enjoy some family time with the couple. She doesn&#39;t always have occasion for that but she is glad for this opportunity. She would turn her head toward Aniyah

&quot;More about me?&quot; She would give a nod &quot;My name is Penelope of the house Asim&#233;niofter&#243;, I&#39;m Ochi second degree cousin from her mother&#39;s family. I&#39;m nineteen years old... nine years younger than the captain.&quot; She felt like a little kid presenting herself in front of an adult, but she doesn&#39;t know what she wanted to say. I&#39;m one of the rarest family members who is more military-focused. So having The captain as a mentor helped me a lot at a young age.&quot;

Ochi served the tea with some sweets to the ladies and fellow Pen discussion with attention.

&quot;I&#39;m from a branch that excels in philosophy and art. My father is a talented man, but sadly I didn&#39;t do anything for him. The first time I met Ochi was in the same place you dated for the first time. It was at a family party. Everyone was dressed well, besides Ochi who wasn&#39;t interested. She was hanging out in the stable helping out....&quot;

&quot;I was sixteen at this time&quot; Ochi added

&quot;And a silly girl I jumped in giving hand cleaning around, but I ended up being grounded as well.&quot; Pen would giggle &quot;The second time was when I completed ten years, an age where I needed a mentor. for my low interest in literature and art, and how hard a student I was. No one chose me to &quot;make me a person&quot;

Ochi replied &quot;Yeah, I remember. So I proposed to myself. I wanted someone to help in my training. By chance, I met her father on one of the ships I used to work in, and during the break, he was talking to me about the struggle of his daughter, how untalented and stubborn she was, and being her master. I took the opportunity... I used her as a walking bag, teaching her nothing. But later on, I discovered her talent.&quot;</span>

It&#39;s as pleasing to her to hear Anyah giggling from the story she was sharing in company with Penelope.  She didn&#39;t expect that the story could be funny, but at the same time, she wonders if the way it was narrated gave it a funny-sounding meaning. But the cousins seemed pleased.

Ochi would get surprised by Aniyah as well, but she figured out that her amnesia affected some of her communication skills.
&quot; Grounding is a general discipline technique which is used with children, in which one is forbidden to leave their place of residence and do things they love, by doing a chore for example. it&#39;s mainly applied when you do a mistake&quot; Ochi said

&quot;Or a punishment &quot; Penelope added &quot;Have you never been grounded?&quot;
&quot;Aniyah was a good girl&quot; Ochi replayed playfully.
&quot;For sure&quot;

Ochi would take a sip of her drink.
&quot;Her skill was purely organizational and she is good at fighting. we trained occasionally&quot;.

Penelope would continue &quot;And during those years, I moved to her family domain, surprisedly I got adopted easily by her mothers and siblings. I should add that the house of Medousa is one of the most terrifying and merciless houses. within the mind, I was terrified to be rejected.  but they ended up being just...&quot; Ochi would nod “And realistic, maybe, being a Yuan-ti family plays a role”</span>

Hearing her fiance mentioning her past, She made a wide smile on her face, Ochi has the feeling that Aniyah starts to remember her past which would let her learn more about her past. The knight loves the company of the actual Aniyah, but she is also more interested to know about the old one. She wants to feel the same heartbeat she had the first day when she expressed her flam to her.

Her gaze still fixes on the woman she loves, looking at her giggles, enjoying every bit of this moment. Her body stayed fixed like a statue. in which it teased the curiosity of Penelope and let her wake up her cousin from the daydream. Penelope would take a sip of the tea and comment. &quot;Captain, you always have a good taste with drinks and food, thank you for recommending this one&quot; She would raise her cup before lowering it again.

Ochi Snapped back &quot;Yes!? Thank you.&quot;

Penelope continued her monologue &quot;Also, my dear Aniyah, I also have a love interest. a relationship that stayed a secret for a while, Only Ochi knows about it. Can&#39;t wait to see him again.&quot;

Ochi would reply &quot;I don&#39;t mind seeing him again, but if you want to make things official... you know the rule&quot;

Penelope lowered her head, gazing at her tea &quot;I know...&quot; Ochi would raise her head again &quot;Even with those rules, I can&#39;t throw away my right hand... Unlike me, you have better communication skills... Well, I always play the bad politeia when you most of the time stay the good politeia&quot;</span>

She blushed a bit at her admission before looking up at Ochi, not having expected her to speak with others about her martial prowess. It wasn&#39;t often she remembered anything of her past so sharing it was even rarer, only comfortable sharing it because she was with Ochi. She would notice Ochi was being incredibly still, unsure of the reason before she took a sip of her own tea. With Penelope waking her from the daydream she wasn&#39;t sure she shouldn&#39;t have done such herself. 

&quot;I&#39;m glad you found someone to be happy with... What rule? I still don&#39;t know much of your house&#39;s rules, my dear. I would appreciate a bit of clarification.&quot;

She moved to set her tea down for the time being, setting back and looking at Ochi expectantly. It was an odd way to put it, throwing away your right hand, but it expressed a bit of her own unsure emotions from the first time Ochi had asked. In truth, the bulk of what they had just said had gone straight past her realm of understanding, though she wondered silently if the rule only applied because it seemed Penelope was interested in a man.  Ochi had insinuated that there were only women in her house, therefore not leaving it out of the realm of possibility.</span>

Well, it&#39;s her job as an Illithian intelligence officer, but she would hope that her lover would not hesitate to share that piece of information with her. She would put her teacup on the table and relay to the question related to the rules.

  [Dragonic] :&quot;Penelope and I are part of a knight Order that serves Lagnia, which have rules that can even affect the personal life of some members. One of those rules is that you are not allowed to declare that you are in a heterosexual relationship or maintain one. I&#39;m a Homo-Pansexual, I lean more toward women, but Penelope is straight.&quot;

&quot;Captain!&quot; Penelope seems embarrassed, but Ochi gave her a head pat to calm her down &quot;Don&#39;t worry, you can trust Aniyah&quot; She would turn her focus again to Aniyah &quot;But if she left the order, she can still serve in the Army&quot;   

Penelope starts lightly sobbing  &quot;I really want to serve the order, it&#39;s the place where I feel I worth something, but sometimes those rules are exaggerating. and every time I hear his name or I see his face I can&#39;t control myself or hold emotion.&quot;</span>

Her pact had been sealed when she had come back to life and while she had no issues sharing what few details she knew with Ochi, Penelope didn&#39;t know about her status of living as far as Aniyah knew. She thought back to that previous hunt where she revealed her secret to Ochi and wondered silently if she hadn&#39;t overheard. She tucked her head shylyas she listened and nodded to Ochi&#39;s explanation.

Hearing Penelope&#39;s distress, she seemed concerned for the girl. She looked to Ochi before taking Penelope in a cool embrace, wishing to comfort the young woman. It was an odd display of care she typically reserved for Ochi, but felt the girl needed reassurance and comfort for her difficult situation.

&quot;That seems like a very unfair rule. Love should be love and I&#39;m sorry you are having this trouble in your heart.&quot;</span>

Ochi would give a nod to Aniyah, indeed Ochi would be interested to learn more about Aniyah&#39;s power. She would also wonder if it had something with her snake, after all, Oku is not a normal snake, her magic can&#39;t let her communicate with it easily as she used to do with her house pet. Essentially, Ochi felt next to Aniyah as a proud wife, having someone in her strength level as a life partner.

Ochi would observe her Fiance trying to calm Penelope down.
&quot;I know, my dear, and I&#39;m working to fix that, but it will take a few generations for a full change.&quot; Penelope would try to calm herself and clean her eyes.
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Captain, I didn&#39;t mean to complain...&quot;  
&quot;You don&#39;t need, Pen, I understand you sweetheart&quot;
After all, even Ochi got herself in a close forbidden relationship. She plans to marry an undead, a thing that will cause her future problems, but her love for Aniyah is stronger than any law in the universe.

&quot;Pen, When we arrive on a border island, I will allow you to stay the night with him.&quot; She would mark a pause &quot;How many days do we still  have?&quot;

&quot;We will arrive, the day after Tomorrow afternoon&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;Thank you, love. It is similar to those, I think, but different powers allowed. I can summon any weapon I wish with the ability to use it rather well, though it doesn&#39;t give me the power to use any other of the weapon as well. I can also read any language you could put infront of me, dispite not being able to particularly speak it.&quot;

She was glad that Ochi seemed to understand her hesitation in talking about her power infront of Penelope, her knowledge of her powers being that it had started when she came out of the darkness. It made Aniyah happy that her love was trying to fix the unfair rule that caused her cousin distress, giving Ochi a greatful smile. That Penelope saw it as complaining made her worry slightly, but was quickly soothed by Ochi&#39;s words. 

Her being undead would no doubt cause issues in the future if people find out, knowing she may not be able to continue Ochi&#39;s line. The allowance for Penelope made her smile, showing that Ochi understood the feelings the girl was dealing with. 

&quot;It seems we are making good time dispite the weather from my limited understanding.&quot;</span>

There are a lot of things needs to learn about her future wife, and she would do everything to bring the woman&#39;s memory back, even if it will evaporate all her savings.

&quot;Indeed, can&#39;t wait to be honest, but I trust my crow to make it at a time&quot; Ochi would turn her attention to Penelope &quot;By the way, Pen, I trust you you can lead us there in less time&quot; she would send a wink to her.

Two days passed with the weather slightly better than the first day was. Ochi prefers to save her energy until she gets to Shinou mainland, even if she believes that she can&#39;t live without a ship, she can get exhausted on board. Plus it will be disturbing to the crow and make them let focus on the travel. So she spent most of her time cuddling with her fiance, teaching her more about the Illithian language, and reading some books with Aniyah.

On the final day, the woman in the crow nest starts screaming &quot;Land! Land!&quot; Ochi would run as quickly as possible with her spyglass to the front of the ship to make sure. She could notice that they arrived at the border Island, a small land far from the mainland by a few miles. It&#39;s a military base controlled by a combined force of two nations, and it&#39;s also a  great diplomatic zone for the leaders to meet up.

&quot;Yeah, we&#39;re close, also ...&quot; Ochi would make a weird face &quot;I didn&#39;t expect to see them there&quot; The knight would fold her spyglass &quot;Looks like we will get our blessing here, Darlings, we will meet one of my mothers here&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">She smiled and tucked her head, unused to but grateful for the compliments, a soft blush crossing her pale cheeks. Ochi&#39;s smile made her heart sing and she was glad that she seemed to have done well in her decisions. They still had much to learn of eachother, and each seemed ever willing before they were tied to eachother further. It was a great relief to Aniyah that she was so willing to further learn about her. What seemed to be a playful tease of her cousin brought out a soft delighted chuckle, showing the young woman as comfortable in the moment.

The two days passed on the ship brought Aniyah to seem fully understanding of the Illithian language, having shown more of her comprehension of the language to Ochi as she taught her. She had been enjoying spending the days cuddling, though now and again she would insist they go on the deck so she could enjoy a piece of the days and they didn&#39;t start feeling stuffy in the room. It was admittedly more so she could enjoy the moments on the ship herself and get Ochi to stretch her legs, but she hoped her love enjoyed the small walks as well.

The final day&#39;s excitement made her giggle as she watched Ochi run to the front of the ship, following behind in measured steps as she watched her love. Hearing that they were close, she would smile until she saw the odd face, concern that something was amiss starting to take shape on her face. The fact they would meet one of her mothers here took her by surprise and her eyes widened at the prospect. That was the last thing she had expected, though perhaps she should have expected it a bit more with getting to know Penelope and having mentioned the oddity of not having met them prior.

&quot;Is this your surprise, my dear?&quot;</span>

She would give a head pet to Aniyah as a way to comfort her. &quot;How you like them, and I will make sure to present you well&quot;  

The ship stops in the island harbor next to an Illithian ship, with two Illiathian houses&#39; flags on top of it, Aniyah could recognize the symbols on them. One with the symbol on the Knight rapier can, and the other similar to the house she had her first date with Ochi in Sofia.

An Officer looking person, who surprisingly looks similar to Ochi, with his cold expression on the face. He makes a singe to his man to help to set up the stairs. The man and his man would be the first getting on the ship, not leaving the chance to Ochi to leave it and welcome her on the ground.

&quot;Major !&quot; Ochi would let her hand close her rapier.
&quot;Captain!&quot; The Man would do the same.
&quot;Darling, step back a little&quot; Ochi would turn her gaze to Aniyah.
Penelope would get closer to Aniyah to show her where she should stand back. The crow and the Major escort would make a large circle around the two officers.

&quot;On guard!&quot; the Major says getting his sword out facing it toward Ochi, which she does the same. the two people start to dual in a choreography dance way. It seems like the blades are singing instead of clashing with each other.

Penelope would look at the show with a smile on her face, like if she is enjoying the thing.</span>

The duel stopped with two planting their swords on the ship&#39;s wood.
&quot;[Dragonic] <span class="spoiler-text spoiler-text--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)">Firstborn...</span>&quot; The Major says
&quot;[Dragonic] <span class="spoiler-text spoiler-text--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)">Little brother</span>&quot; Ohi the other man brother
&quot;I didn&#39;t see you for ages&quot; he would say to Anyah and Penelope &quot;Happy to see you again Penelope, and&quot; The man switched to Shinou language &quot;And you are Lady Aniyah I presume&quot; He would switch to common Welcome to brother Island. then he continues in Draconic &quot;<span class="spoiler-text spoiler-text--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)">You come in good time, I didn&#39;t say to Mothers and Sister that you are coming... to make a surprise</span>&quot;
Ochi would reply in Draconic&quot;<span class="spoiler-text spoiler-text--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)">A surprise indeed, you didn&#39;t tell me they were here, please escort us.</span>&quot; The Major would take the lead with his Men.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">She was nervous even with Ochi trying to comfort her and put her at ease, worried more about what Penelope had said prior than she probably should. Looking at the familiar flags of the other ship for a moment, she nodded to Ochi at her words. The differences made her wonder silently how far the family stretched and how many symbols she would have to learn for them, finding it odd but figuring it may be another cousin or something of the like in the moment.

She peeked around Ochi to look at the man for a moment before Ochi&#39;s words reached her ears, surprised by the similarities between the two. Ochi had only ever mentioned having women in her family and now she was confused by the prospect. She backed away from her love as requested and joined Penelope looking a bit more confused until the beginning of the duel and the blades singing together brought her to take another step back in unease. She didn&#39;t wish to be rude as she fought the urge to disappear behind the circle, keeping her eyes low and tucking her head. 

She looked to Ochi in surprise and confusion, trying to process all that was happening at once. It was a bit overwhelming and she wasn&#39;t sure how to process it all, seeming there was much more to this surprise than she had presumed. The acknowledgement in Shiwen was less surprising than the person himself, not having expected to meet so many new people in the day.

Draconic <span class="spoiler-text spoiler-text--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)">&quot;Yes I am. I&#39;m afraid I do not have the advantages of knowing who you are however.&quot;</span>

She took from Ochi&#39;s words that she was only expected to be meeting this brother today originally as she let Ochi lead her. It was a process to comprehend all that was happening at once, leaving her to be led by Ochi in the moment.</span>

Ochi would get in the lower level of her fience&#233;, as a way of asking her for an apology &quot;I&#39;m sorry Aniyah for making you uncomfortable,  I will clear all the confusion.&quot; she would take both Aniyah&#39;s hands and kiss them &quot;Everything has a reason, and everything related to my family follows some boring protocol... tell me if you need time, I can send Pen to inform others that we will stay in the ship for a moment.&quot;

Mostly she was starting to see that Ochi may very well have lied upon their first meeting just as Hoklathi had suspected, though not about what he thought. 

Draconic <span class="spoiler-text spoiler-text--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)">&quot;Well met. I&#39;m afraid she hadn&#39;t told me about you... at all.&quot;</span>

It seemed like an odd thing, to be presented to a family member that was openly denied from her memory on Sofia, the new knowledge stinging a bit with not understanding why he would be. Even with the more matriarchal style of Illithyian culture it seemed like a foreign concept to deny who you blood is. 

She listened to Ochi, a small frown on her lips as she nodded to her apology.  She didn&#39;t wish to be mad at Ochi at all, however the fact she would openly lie to her had her questioning a little. 

&quot;I am alright... You just never told me you have a brother. I only knew of your sister. You have a few things you need to explain and... nevermind... Let&#39;s us go on... your family is waiting.&quot;</span>

&quot;It&#39;s a long story, but, you will understand everything&quot;

Ochi would stand up with a smile on herself, and take her fiance&#39;s arms once again. She would lead Aniyah out to the dock and head toward the island, where the major is waiting for her with one of his men. Penelope would follow the couple quietly, as usual, ready to serve her superior at any minute, with no hesitation.  

&quot;So Major... you didn&#39;t tell me that the general and the Senator would be here&quot;

&quot;It was sudden, Captain,  well, we were able to prepare for both of your visits, but I wasn&#39;t able to send the litter in time.&quot;

&quot;I see... I&#39;m not disappointed, can&#39;t wait to let my house meet my future wife&quot; She would turn her gaze toward Aniyah, wondering if her opinion about her changed. The knight doesn&#39;t want to be called a liar by Ani, but she is forced to be secretive about things.

&quot;You said earlier General and Senator, assuming they are two, Your sister is also here&quot;
 
&quot;Like I said I&#39;m not disappointed&quot; She seems really disappointed, Ochi doesn&#39;t like meeting odds and events that she didn&#39;t calculate. She would show that with a sight. &quot;Are they having a meeting?&quot;

&quot;Yeah with some Shinou envoy, come, let&#39;s have a sit&quot;  He would point toward a well-shaded table. Ochi would lead Aniyah to her seat and help her to get comfortable before she sits as well.

Didn&#39;t take a lot of minutes to see six figures leaving one of the cabins, three feminine figures, and three male figures. The three-man head directly toward some ship, while the other would look around, they seem to like looking for someone. One of them starts waving toward the table.
&quot;SIIIIIISTER!&quot;
&quot;The cheerful version of me is coming,&quot; Ochi commented on what she was looking at. The Young woman waving comes running toward the three arms open. Ochi would grin before standing up and heading toward the running woman.</span>

&quot;You know that your big sister is busy as well. &#39;&#39; There is a clear difference between both women, the twin is shorter with short hair.

[Dragonic]&quot; We will talk later, okay,&quot; Ochi says to Major

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">That he seemed complacent in the arrangement and expected her answer didn&#39;t do much to make her feel better about it, seeing it as almost a dismissal of his existence. She looked up at Ochi as they walked, allowing herself to be led and join the major once more. A smile graced her face as a practiced, soft smile, not wanting to come across as upset to those she was meeting. She gleaned from the conversation that she was only supposed to meet the Major today and that the rest were unexpected. 

She put her hand on Ochi&#39;s for reassurance, while upset, she did still love her. It didn&#39;t so much change her opinion as worry her about what may have been lied about, which she was near certain her love would probably be willing to tell her now. She caught herself studying the man a bit before looking down, trying not to be rude though she was having trouble grasping that he was here. The last thing she would have expected was meeting Ochi&#39;s brother.

&quot;I am... a bit nervous...&quot;

She tried to explain away her odd behavior as they went to sit. Ochi&#39;s disappointment hadn&#39;t escaped her, making her wonder the reason she denied what was clear. When the three women spotted them and the loud call brought her to jump a bit in h&#247;r seat, not having expected it and being so tense.

She let Ochi have her greetings as she turned to smile at Sif, showing she accepted and appreciated his company for who he was. She didn&#39;t understand most of it, but she wanted him to feel apart of the family. When she was addressed, she tucked her head a bit, unused to all those around her finding her cute.</span>

The cold tone the supposedly cheerful sister took with their brother brought a look of concern to her face, not expecting such from someone deemed cheerful. She offered him another smile as he got up to leave.

[Draconic] &quot;I hope we can sit again another time. It was nice meeting you, brother.&quot;

She then turned to finally address Ouran with a slight bow and stoic face.

&quot;Well met... Yes. I&#39;m Aniyah, the youngest of House Nishezhee. Elis&#225;vet mentioned you. She told me you cared for the gardens on Sofia?&quot;</span>

What Aniyah doesn&#39;t know about the other&#39;s family, is they follow some rules that sound weird and unjustified to the outside world. Ochi was collecting her thoughts to give a convincing answer to Aniyah after dinner, hoping this time it would be more satisfying.  And hoping that her first-day lies will not have a major impact on their relationship. One thing Ochi believes in is that every problem has its solution, and every solution would calm the waves again.

Ochi would give a head pate when she hears that her fiance mentioned that she was nervous. She would bright her face with a smile to share some peace of mind with her.  She would send her a message in her mind &quot;<span class="spoiler-text spoiler-text--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)">Babe please relax, I will explain everything later. Trust me everything about my family has somehow a clear explanation.</span>&quot;  

Oran would make a weird face when she hears the two talking in Draconic, she seems not understanding the language. &quot;Indeed, Sweet Aniyah, It seems that my sister presented me to you&quot; Oran would make a wide smile on her face. she seems to behave like a regular human. Maybe she looks like Ochi, but she is her Human alternative. The young woman would take the Major seat who had just left the table, and ask Penelope to bring two more seats like if she was a made-a-maid. Not enjoying the way she was addressed, she would turn her head toward Ochi. The knight would sight and give a nod to Penelope with a &quot;Please!&quot;. Penelope would give a nod with a smile on her face and fitch some extra chairs. Ochi would hold the hand of her sister with a serious look on her face. Oran would remove her hand, and shrugged &quot;Okey, I&#39;m sorry sis&quot;

Two female figures showed up in front of the group, one with white Ilithian clothing, blond with well-put makeup on her face. with a brighter smile on her face. The other, she is wearing a military uniform of high rank with simple makeup consisted of black lipstick on her pale face.</span>

 &quot;House Nishezhee... Please accept my condolence&quot;  A silence could be heard around

This felt off however and it didn&#39;t sit as right, seeing how Ochi interacted with her brother. While Oran seemed a bit more stuck up dispite having been described as happier, seeing her be quite cold to her own brother. Ochi had mentioned the Oran was a false twin and hadn&#39;t learned the languages the Yuan-ti would have learned, leading her to not be surprised when she hadn&#39;t understood.

She offered Penelope a soft smile, mirroring the distaste for the way Ochi&#39;s sister seemed to treat some of her own family. It was odd at least and worrisome at worst, deciding to be wary but not hostile. Aniyah took in the two approaching figures, offering a warm, practiced smile as she stood to greet them and allow herself to be presented by Ochi as she had said. She would give a slight bow of respect to the two, noting that they hadn&#39;t come in with any open hostility like their more human daughter. She heard the condolences and nodded a bit, lowering her eyes to the ground for a quick moment.

&quot;Thank you... It&#39;s something I&#39;ve accepted.&quot;

She turned her attentions to the more gleeful spirit who was now apologizing to her. A slight shake of her head was all she could muster before she spoke and gave the woman a cool hug, unsure of what else she really could do.

&quot;Please don&#39;t trouble yourself about it. I just wish I could remember them so I might grieve in the way they deserve. Forward isn&#39;t a bad thing at all.&quot;</span>

&quot;Aniyah!&quot; She says with a proud voice &quot;The cheerful woman who just hugged you is Lady Artem&#237;da of house Asim&#233;niofter&#243;, My mother and Penelope&#39;s Auntie.&quot;  Artem&#237;da would draw a soft smile on her face. &quot;The woman sitting next to her is General Gloydia Opsidania of house Medousa and its head...  and my commander.&quot; Artem&#237;da would continue the presentation, &quot;And Elis&#225;vet Mother, but my wife <strong>blushes</strong> when someone mentions her other title.&quot;  Gloydia would sight a says &quot;Anyway, Nice to meet you Lady Aniyah, hope you would enjoy our family company.&quot; She didn&#39;t sit for too long, she would stand and askes Ochi to follow her. Ochi would turn toward her fiance&#233; &quot;General seems eager to talk to me in private... I will be back as soon as possible&quot; The two women leave the table heading to one of the island&#39;s small houses.

Oran would steal Och&#39;s place to talk with Aniyah &quot;Tell me, tell me... how did you meet my sister, and how your love story started, I want to hear everything... My big Sis Share only power points of her adventures, she doesn&#39;t develop much&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The bubbly nature of Ochi&#39;s carrier mother made her feel a bit more at ease, not unused to the typical pokerface of her kin. It was a rare moment that even Hoklathi had shown a grain of emotion, so only the fact she didn&#39;t know them well was putting her on edge. She quietly hoped it didn&#39;t show how tense she was meeting them all at once, knowing it was most likely her original intent to introduce her slowly. She gave slight bows to each as a sign of respect when Ochi introduced them, giggling lightly when Artem&#237;da continues the introduction for Gloydia. 

&quot;Its a pleasure to meet all of you. I&#39;m sure I will be happy to be in your family&#39;s company. Thank you for the welcome.&quot;

That Gloydia didn&#39;t sit long made her nervous, wondering if she perhaps did something wrong. She nodded a little at Ochi&#39;s words, a bit of concern behind her eyes as she looks up at her love. She watched Ochi a bit as the women left to one of the houses, looking to Oran when she moved.

&quot;Umm... She invited me to meet on Sofia when I reached Anyasse. I had only met one other person at that time so it was not quite expected that anyone would know I was there yet as my teacher is a very private person. We met for tea and she seemed to enjoy Oku&#39;s company as well. But please... Tell me about yourselves. I would love to know more about both of you.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">After the mother and her daughter left the company, the two women who left would get closer to Aniyah. Plus to Penelope who preferred to stay next to Aniyah, after all the woman seems to enjoy the company of the young Shinou noblewoman rather than being close to the General. Would keep a warm smile on her face, would make a soft giggle about how Ochi and Aniyah met. She seems really enjoying the short story version of the young couple&#39;s first meeting. Oran would make a grin with eyes closed like she is used to seeing this kind of scene.

&quot;Eliz is somehow classic in the way she approaches people, especially the once that piqued her curiosity from her agents&#39; reports. She is not that social, to pick a girl in a bar to flirt with them&quot; The mother says.
&quot;Unless she was in public baths, where other women can admire&quot; The sister replied.
&quot;Well, when she was a teen discovering herself, Unlike you little Oran, who was still lusting around like a succubus&quot; Artem&#237;da replied to Oran in Sarcastic way. &quot;MOM&quot; the twin starts getting all red.
It&#39;s clear that Illithian people are very open about this kind of subject.

Artem&#237;da would turn her attention back to her guest, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, darling, I know that Shinou people are pretty reserved about this kind of subject, also who is Oku? I assume it is your pet, a pet snake right?&quot; she would hear Aniyah&#39;s question and start to ponder about it.
&quot;From where I should start... Yeah, I&#39;m a former minister and Senator. As you could notice, I don&#39;t have a scale... I&#39;m an Aasmare, like Oran... and Oran is a people&#39;s Tribune, she is still young to be a Senator.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">She quietly appreciated that Penelope stuck closer to her, feeling a bit surrounded by those she had only just met. Her discomfort didn&#39;t show as she painted a practiced smile on her face and policed her breathing, keeping a facade of calm as she tried to get used to them. She idly wondered how many Ochi may have approached before her as they spoke, blushing bright as she looked at Oran in surprise.

It hadn&#39;t seemed like something Ochi would do to flirt in the public baths, at least from what she was gathering from her sister&#39;s words. She didn&#39;t remember much about her younger years, finding the little she did know being that she seemed to be a very angry girl. She couldn&#39;t imagine herself lusting around like Artem&#237;da had just said Oran was still doing. A hand covered her mouth in shock and she blinked a few times before glancing at Oran once more.

&quot;Oku is my companion. He&#39;s been by my side since I lost my memories. Elis&#225;vet and I also have Asimi now as well. I believe they are still cozy on the ship.&quot;

She remembered Ochi explaining how her mother was an Aasimar and her sister as well, making them false twins. A small chuckle escaped her as she found it slightly humorous that she might be a tribune from lusting around.

&quot;I suppose I can see how she might be a tribune if she does as you said.... a joke of course.&quot;</span>

She jumped on Ani again and gave her a hug. &quot;Thank you, you made me forget about the boring I just had... you know what, you earned my blessing&quot;

Oran would facepalm, and sight. She seemed to be more annoyed by her mother&#39;s laugh than the joke. she expected to get such a remark. &quot;Nice one, but no&quot;

 Artem&#237;da calmed herself and corrected the situation as fast as possible &quot;I need to give Oran some credit but do a good work around&quot; She felt the need to give some justice toward her daughter while having a nice time in the company of Ochi&#39;s fiancee. But her facial expression changed, it seems like she just possessed what the girl said. A reaction that she got at the same time with Oran, like if they were sending mental messages between them.

&quot;You said you lost your memory, and amnesia&quot; Oran would say &quot;It may feel painful sometimes, not being able to know who you were, if my assumption was right&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">She smiled and tucked her head, partly having expected a different response from the mother after what she had suggested in jest. When she laughed so hard she started to cry, a sliver of concern shown through, staying quiet before letting out a small squeak at the surprise hug. She lightly pat the woman&#39;s back in return, shooting Oran a slightly apologetic look dispite not being the main object of her annoyance.

&quot;I&#39;m sure, but the opportunity was simply lined up too well. I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it, Lady Artem&#237;da. That was indeed my intention, but my apologies go out to Oran of course for making her the punchline.&quot;

She was surprised when they seemed to only now understand her lack of memory. While she had been spending alot of time in the library to learn much of what she had felt she should learn, it couldn&#39;t replace the holes in her memories that left her unknowing of her family or how she had been. She fully turned to Oran when she offered a measure of comfort.

&quot;I feel as though I was ment to be how I am now. As I said earlier, I only wish I could remember those of my house so I may mourn them properly. They were my family after all and I should hope to honor them in the ways I can.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Oran would shake her head as a sign of negation, it seems she accepted Aniyah&#39;s apology before she asked for it. She would make a wide smile on her face. Type of expression that Ochi is having a hard time making in her face, not because she can&#39;t physically do it, but she never felt the need to make besides a little smile. The tween would reach her two hands trying to catch Aniyah&#39;s.

&quot;I don&#39;t mind a little roast from time to time, especially from a new member of our family.&quot; Oran would grin. &quot;and about your memory loss, I really hope I can help you. but I heard some kind of emotional shock could help you to get some back...&quot; She was about to add something but she stopped herself. &quot;And I see that my daughter is doing her best to help you,&quot; Artem&#237;da added. 

&quot;Tell me, between us, how do you feel being in the company of someone you love twin... We look the same, even if I have short hair and more make-up on my face than hers&quot; Oran would make another grin, it was an attempt to change the subject, but her face is still hiding some emotions. Also, Oran would show some kind of curiosity toward this kind of subject. 

While talking it seems that Ochi and her other mother left the building. facing directly toward Ani, before being called by some soldier, whose she turns toward and nods before she starts cleaning her forehead. The Two Yuan-ti are heading toward the table to join the others. Ochi, walking behind the general, gave Aniyah a thump up.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">She was glad that Oran wasn&#39;t upset about being the punchline of her joke, even so much as offering a wide smile to her. She offered a soft smile in return, not much for over expressing herself much similar to the rest of her kin. The most emotion she tended to show was when Ochi was there to calm her nerves, glad that she seemed to be doing good navigating the pleasantries with these two.

&quot;I try not to dwell too much on the past. It seems some things do let me remember certain things. My first memory came back after a fight in the bloodpits and I dont particularly wish for a repeat of the occurrence. Seems most of what I remember are negative events after all.&quot;

She nodded her confirmation to Artem&#237;da, confirming that Ochi was doing what she could to help with the situation. The change in topic came as a surprise, not truly having been thinking about it. While the similarities were there in their looks, she was confident she&#39;d be able to tell the difference based on how they treated others. 

&quot;I wasn&#39;t particularly thinking about it. Your personalities are very different so even if you were identical there would be a distinct difference between you both. I also wasn&#39;t expecting to meet so many of Elis&#225;vet&#39;s family at once either...&quot;

Seeing Ochi and her mother leave the building, brought her attention to them. She idly wondered why she needed to clean her forehead and what could&#39;ve been said to warrant her needing confirmation. A small smile came to her lips dispite the unknown aspects of her current situation.</span>

My wife especially has a unique habit that I never see in my parents&#39; family. she communicates with us magically.&quot; She would ponder, by raising her hands to support her head, while gazing to the skies &quot; I don&#39;t know how to explain it&quot; she would lower her head to meet Aniyah eyes &quot;But Ochi, like her grandfather, My father, She communicates by letters.

The two women would notice the regard switching of Aniyah, they would both look at the direction of Ochi and the general. Aniyah would notice that her lover is following the commander from the back, summoning her brother back to join the table, and still cleaning her forehead, which has a mark of what seems like coal, or black lipstick.  


The young knight would get closer to her lover with a wide smile on her face, a smile that Ani never saw before. A smile that emits some kind of positive energy. A smile of a person who just drops a hug wight from their shoulder. A smile of satisfaction. Ochi was simply happy, a happiness that she experiences rarely. It&#39;s the second instance of happiness that the undead could witness coming from Ochi. The knight would come from behind the Shinouan woman and embrace her.

&quot;General, Mother... and of course my sister. I know it&#39;s early to ask for this, but I want to formally make this request in front of every close member of the two houses.  I, Elis&#225;vet Psevdoker&#225;stes, second in command of the house Midousa, I want to ask your blessing to Marry Aniyah of the house  Nishezhee of Shinou&quot;</span>

And don&#39;t you miss seeing each other regularly? Apologies that seems foreign to me, but from what little I remember, I was never alone...&quot;

She was trying to understand the dynamic, but coming up short to understand without more information, not really knowing how to ask. It was sweet that Ochi would communicate with letters and leave that physical item to be cherished if one was feeling they missed her, but being in one&#39;s physical presence seemed like it would be more connecting to her. When she looked to Ochi wiping off the mark that matched her other mother&#39;s lips she would hold back the small chuckle that it seemed she recieved affection from the otherwise stoic woman. 

It was out of character for her love to show as much emotion as in this moment as she got closer, leaving Aniyah to look up at her with a soft curiosity and warm smile. That the major was asked to join them once more made her feel content,  happy he was no longer excluded from what seemed a family affair. The happiness seemed to radiate from Ochi and brought a full smile to her own face as she leaned into the embrace, placing her cool hands over her love&#39;s for the moment. A look of surprised shock crossed her face at Ochi&#39;s words, quickly replaced by by a deep blush across her cheeks. She hadn&#39;t realized Ochi hadn&#39;t already had their blessing when she proposed to her before, though it now made quite a bit of sense seeing as its the first she&#39;d met the rest of her family. And she most certainly didn&#39;t know what Ochi&#39;s other mother thought of her with them making such a quick exit before.</span>

The half-angel mother would draw a curious smile on her face, she seemed to enjoy the question. Indeed, The way she described telepathy and message cantrip, may give the idea that intimacy and exchanging of real words is pretty rare in their relationship with the general. she would make eye contact with Aniyah and answer with passion.

&quot;There are a lot of misconceptions about Yuan-ti, especially Illithian ones&quot; pointing out the Ochi house &quot;They have a unique way of communicating their emotion, especially with their romantic partners. I&#39;m not sure how Anyassian and Shinouan Yuan-ti behave, but I believe they kept their old tradition&quot;  She would turn her head toward her wife who is coming behind her &quot;But the general is the one who misses me a lot, emotionally and sexually and sexualy and gets jealous... But I love her&quot; She said in a low voice, so the others couldn&#39;t hear her.</span>

[After that Ochi announced her project]

The Oran stood up, and started clapping from excitement from the announcement Ochi made, she seemed the most enthusiastic one. Meanwhile, the mothers kept calm for a while, they were looking at each other&#39;s eyes, Artem&#237;da looking at the eyes of the General, who was still standing up, her gaze pointed at her wife. It seems that General seems unsure, even if she knows what&#39;s going on, like she didn&#39;t have enough time to think about the subject. She would take a seat on the nearest chair while keeping eye contact.

Ochi offers a nod of gratitude to her sister, but her attention is still on their mothers&#39; decision. She starts to get worried, she doesn&#39;t like when they start taking time, sending mental messages to each other, while she is waiting for an answer.
Oran stops clapping, not comfortable with what&#39;s going on. &quot;Please, say yes,&quot; the sister says.

&quot;Mom, General... I understand you already have plans regarding my future that could benefit our house. But for once I want to choose the person with whom I would want to end my days.&quot;

The parents kept quiet again. but their silence was broken with an optimistic sight from the General, accompanied with a benevolent smile.

&quot;Captain Psevdoker&#225;stes!&quot; says the general &quot;you are still silly after those days, You know that we have already given you our blessing, why do you askes again.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;From what little i know, its frowned upon to show emotions for a Yuan-ti of Shinou. Before today, I had only met one other and he became my teacher. There was only once he has shown anything akin to pride and that was when I called him out for considering me a potential kill... He said I have potential... I however have very little to base these things off of.&quot;

A slight blush crossed her cheeks as Artem&#237;da spoke so openly about the general missing her in those ways, jealousy seeming an odd trait for a married woman when her understanding was that they were each other. The new knowledge made her wonder if Ochi was similar in that regard, knowing she hadn&#39;t said much about Tariq when agreeing to meet him.

Oran being so enthusiastic brought a small smile to her lips as she leaned back comfortably into Ochi&#39;s arms, that Artem&#237;da gave her blessing making her feel more comfortable in doing so. The wariness that the general seemed to have over the situation made her inwardly uneasy as she looked up to Ochi, wishing she knew a bit more about what they already knew about her. While she found it sweet that her love seemed to tell them all she could about her, she wished that Ochi had told her more about them as well and not left her at a bit of a disadvantage. While trying not to stare she brought her gaze across each of their faces, trying to assess the situation as she kept quiet. 

It seemed she wasn&#39;t the only one who was uncomfortable with the silent conversation going on infront of them, Oran&#39;s few words confirming the mood. Her gaze shifted to Ochi as she spoke, a soft smile appearing once more on her face as she listened. The smiling general and her own words drew a slightly surprised look from her, barely having spoken to the woman and the wariness from just a moment ago. She gently put her hands over her heart and bowed her head to the women, a silent thank you in her smile before looking back to Ochi.</span>

The knight would kiss their mothers’ hand and put her forehead on her hand. She starts by giving it to the general, followed by her Aasamar mother. Artem&#237;da would stand up to give a motherly hug to her. Oran would stand up as well and give a large hug to her sister. The Major would simply give a head bow with a smile on his face.

The General smile feinted to show her usual serious face. She would turn her face to Major to ask him if it is possible to have dinner ready in the evening. Which he gives a positive answer. &quot;We Expected Captain and her fiance&#39;s visit, so we prepared everything.&quot;
The General would give a nod, and turn to the couple. &quot;You are free to retreat to a private room or enjoy yourself in the harbor until dinner. After all, Captain, you have no official mission here.&quot;
&quot;Indeed General&quot; Ochi replied and turn her head toward Aniyah &quot;What do you think darling?&quot;

Artem&#237;da nor Oran didn&#39;t give feedback on the Shinouan tradition. It seems  Like they were cut by the Arrival of the mother and the daughter.</span>

She looked up as Ochi let out a sigh and smiled with a sigh of her own, glad that she had a reassurance as well that she seemed to have needed. The kiss on her head felt nice though it brought a soft blush to her creeks, not particularly used to having so many people around her that she would have to know with open displays like that. It was reassuring in a way with how it told her she was doing good with Ochi&#39;s family.

She watched patiently as Ochi kissed the hands of each of her mothers and recieved hugs, enjoying the moment from her spot. The sweet moment was a rarity that she felt should be enjoyed, imagining Ochi didn&#39;t see her family often from her mother&#39;s words prior. The general going back to serious to speak once more made her feel a bit smaller even with the words not being harsh so much as stern. The words offered the suggestion they would all be having dinner together this evening and brought a small nod from her, more processing and confirming with herself than an answer. 

The thought of a private room brought a slight blush to her cheeks after the things Artem&#237;da had said about the general missing her. Looking up at Ochi when she addressed her she smiled and nodded.

&quot;I believe a private room would be good for now. Perhaps if there&#39;s enough time we could enjoy the harbor as well.&quot;

She wasn&#39;t sure where to start but some things needed answered before she accidentally made a fool of herself. It didn&#39;t help that she was a bit overwhelmed and nervous, not truly feeling like she could show it.</span>

Maybe they saw how confused and intimidated the Shinouan woman was, so they preferred to let Ochi take charge of teaching her, that may take time. But Ochi knows how smart her fiance is. The Aasamar mother would keep a cheerful smile on her face, and Yuan-ti mother showing off her long face but with smiling eyes.

&quot;Alright, darling let&#39;s have some rest then I will give you a visit to the place... the sunset is beautiful here&quot;
&quot;Alright, Your mother and I have work to finish here&quot; the General replied
&quot;See you later my beautiful daughters,&quot; Artem&#237;da says before standing up, followed by Oran.

Ochi would land her hand to Aniyah to escort her to their temporary house on the island. The Major would hand the keys to them, with the mention that it was prepared for us. Ochi would then thank him before leading the way. Along the way, the knight was thinking about how to resume the situation about her brother, and the lie that she never met a male Yuan-ti before. 

&quot;Babe !?&quot; She says to grab her lover&#39;s attention &quot;I believe I have to explain myself. -She continues in Dragonic- <span class="spoiler-text spoiler-text--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"> I&#39;m sorry for hiding the truth, but everything had a clear explanation like I told you</span>&quot; She hoped her words would be able to make it clear. 

From the outside, this house looks gorgeous. It has been built with teak wood and metallic decorations. It had one floor, including the ground floor, squared windows allowed enough light to enter the home and had been added to the house in a fairly symmetrical pattern. The house is equipped with a modest kitchen and one average bathroom on the first floor, it also has a fairly small living room, three other rooms.</span>

Having Ochi near again had helped immensely with her comfort though she still worried about her ability to read the room and not make a fool out of herself. She would offer a small, shy smile to the two mothers.

&quot;Thank you. I greatly appreciate all of you willing to accept me after such a shot time. It has been a few years now that I have been without my family and to have a new one makes me very greatful and happy.&quot;

She had felt the need to say something though it hadn&#39;t been asked of her, wanting to express how much it ment to her. Looking to each as they spoke once more before her gaze rested on Ochi once more, she tried to decide what she would say when they got to the room as she took her love&#39;s hand.

&quot;That sounds lovely, dear. The sunset can make up for the one we missed on the first day of travel. Don&#39;t you think?&quot;

There were a few things to discuss for when they got there and Aniyah was lost in her own thoughts as they made their way to the temporary housing, trying to think of a way to approach the subject. She hadn&#39;t expected that Ochi had lied to her and it still didn&#39;t sit right with her, as if part of Ochi&#39;s family wasn&#39;t being acknowledged. Ochi grabbing her attention pulled her from her thoughts and made her jump, giving a nod of affirmation that she did need to explain herself.

The house made her eyes widen a little, spending most of her time in her small apartment with her plants or visiting Ochi.</span>

&quot;Why lie to me? Are there any other things you&#39;ve been less than forthright with? I&#39;m not particularly happy with this Ochi... I thought I could trust you at your word... I don&#39;t understand.&quot;</span>

She would get a cup and then take a deep breath. looking in front of her, avoiding eye contact. her eyebrows would be lowered and pulled closer together, her corners of their mouth may point downward, And her leg starts shaking.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;ve been forced to hide this kind of information, faking some of my opinions for the sake of my family interest.&quot;  She would lower her head toward the table, gazing deeply into it. &quot;My mothers had four kids, two twins. The oldest was Oran and me. The youngest others were male. A Yuan-ti and an Aasamar. Like me and my sister. But because of the law of our house and the island we hail from, we are not allowed to have male members. After their first week with us, With my mother&#39;s to be exact. They were sent to Shinou to be raised with the auxiliary army known as sons of Hephaestus. And they reported to us that they were dead, ... and they were female. So for a long time. Until my early teens, before I met Pen when I learned the truth. It was here on this island, for my training. That day my mothers was here as well.&quot; A water drop left Ochi&#39;s eyes and fell on the table, and her voice changed &quot;That day I found out that my parents lied to me and my sister about our brothers. That day I learned that Aasamar died, so they came to take his dead body to bury it.&quot; Ochi kept quiet, trying to calm herself.

&quot;I lied to you because you were a stranger to me that day, and I wanted to protect you from the walls. Also, my sister doesn&#39;t know the truth. So when she heard you saying brother, she assumed that you are brothers by kin. Like if Yuan-ti would call another brother and sister&quot;

Ochi would wonder what she would feel about her, she doesn&#39;t want to be hated by the woman fall in love with. Is she going to forgive me, she said to herself. She lowers her head and says with a faint voice full of sorrow and regret.

&quot;Would you forgive me?&quot;</span>

The answer itself brought a frown to her face, hearing that it was a forced consequence of her house in a way. It had been so easy to believe the lie before because of the environment only having women around, remembering the explanation of the sons of Hephaestus from before on the ship. She caught the sight of the tear hitting the table at the edge of her vision, finally looking back up to her love. 

That there was a second, lost brother tugged at her heart with a heavy feeling, almost feeling as though Ochi had been cheated out of not knowing her siblings. The reasoning of her being a stranger was sound enough, but didn&#39;t explain her intention to surprise her with this fact rather than tell her when they had become close. Even herself had hidden part of herself at first meeting, but had told her love as they got closer. That Oran still was unaware brought a furrow to her brow, feeling as though that might cause a larger issue than necessary if she were to find out how harshly she was treating her own sibling.

&quot;I have many more questions... but I would forgive you. My feelings for you have not changed, but I dont understand your intentions to continue to hide it after we became closer. It seems like you were planning to surprise me with it when we got here?</span>

She lightly put a hand on Ochi&#39;s cheek, having her look at her in the eyes. There were several concerns in her eyes and not all of them were voiced yet as she was trying to figure out how to word them. She didn&#39;t want the answers out of fear but knew they needed asked.

&quot;And if I were able to bear children and any were male, what would that mean? The little I remember, I always had a male member of my house with me... even when... I wouldn&#39;t wish to give up any of our children if they are ours... It hurts to think about...&quot;</span>

During those nights she would get nightmares about how her younger brother died. in her logical mind. She could understand why she had no right to learn about their existence, but at the same time, she felt like her lifestyle doesn&#39;t make sense for her.

The knight was glad she showed her feeling in front of the woman she loves, she can&#39;t accept the ridicule if she had a similar breakdown in public. She would the warmth of her Aniyah&#39;s hands in her cheek, she would grab it and kiss it. She is happy that she accepted her apology.  &quot;Thank you, my love, for understanding me&quot;
She would draw a smile on her face full of remaining sadness. &quot;And for the remaining questions, I will try to answer them to the best of my best.&quot; She would her lover head from the back, and give a little kiss on the forehead. A kiss that represents her comfort.

She heard Aniyah&#39;s question about the potential male offspring, she would ponder about it for a moment then says. &quot;It&#39;s a good question actually, and I don&#39;t make them suffer, like my brothers... I&#39;ve been thinking of a solution for ages. But one thing I&#39;m sure of, I will not lie about their existence to my daughters.&quot; She would burst a laugh out &quot;Also I&#39;m lucky that my sister and I are lesbians... I can&#39;t Imagine the hierarchy&quot;

She calmed again to continue her serious conversation, and take another sip from the water. Ochi started to realize she is getting more human, day after day. She started to accept the emotions that she felt she wasn&#39;t allowed to bring to have or bring them to the table. But at least it was with the woman she cared for.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">That Ochi had begun to cry spoke volumes to how deeply the situation had imprinted on her, showing just how she felt on the matter and showed Aniyah that Ochi had some stronger feelings that aligned with her own. She smiled softly when Ochi kissed her hand, offering a comfort as she tucked herself against her love. She wished to be closer to her love and not allow a potential misunderstanding with her words, not wanting Ochi to think she is angry with her. It had been a conversation for behind closed doors so that she might better understand what was going on in the family dynamic. 

The sad smile Ochi drew on her face hurt Aniyah&#39;s heart, not enjoying the fact she was still hurt by it all. The reassurance that she was now more than willing to answer her questions was encouraging however and worked to put her at ease, even though she skipped over the first questions and went to the more important ones for their future together. She would nod with the answers, knowing that was the best she could get for the time being until they could come up with a solution.

&quot;I can accept that for now... Please don&#39;t hide things from me Ochi... I already don&#39;t know so much about my own life and now I do not even know how to act around your family.... I already find it quite lucky that my joke on Oran&#39;s promiscuity went over so smoothly... I don&#39;t wish to ruin their opinion of me. I need your help with these things Ochi...&quot;

She placed a light hand on Ochi&#39;s thigh and she leaned against her, disliking that she seemed to have taken on a more panicked tone than she had thought she would&#39;ve portrayed. It wasn&#39;t too off the mark than what she&#39;d been feeling prior when surrounded by those she was only just meeting, leaving her more vulnerable than most times she allowed some emotion to show.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ochi seeing her fiance tucked herself against her, embraced her with her arms sharing the comfort of each other. She wondered if she didn&#39;t hurt her lover with her words or reaction after mentioning her past. After all, she is the only one to whom she can expose her emotions and weaknesses. She would offer another kiss, and make a slight relief. She would listen to her lover&#39;s words and reply to them with a smile.

&quot;Nobody will hate you, Darling, you are the best thing that could happen to this family.  You helped me and you saved me along the way. You made me give myself a chance to talk and say things I was hiding in my chest for years. I will help you and protect you no matter what. even if you get your memory back, and come back to your old self, I will always love you.&quot;

She would give a tight hug, then release her, keeping her hand holding the woman&#39;s arms. She would look into her eyes deeply,  enjoying its beauty. She would feel something weird, like if she found another aspect of Aniyah&#39;s face, now that she is feeling sad. She would give her a headset with a smiling face.  She takes a deep breath.

&quot;I need to fresh up myself, then if you want, we can go for a walk&quot;

Ochi would stand up and head to the bathroom, and take some fresh water from a barrel. She fixed the mirror and removed her eyepatch. Ochi starts feeling some pain while her head and eyes start to shift, revealing her new form. She started to clean her face with the water while hearing her snaky hissing with no sense. She dried her face and put on her eyepatch again. To come back to her natural form and says to herself “the real question is, is she still gonna love me when I reveal my abomination form”</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The comforting embrace from Ochi helped to calm her a bit as she offered her own in return, trying to sift through her emotions in the moment. She had been more upset by the fact Ochi had continued to hide it from her even once they were together, never worried about her love sharing things with her, but hiding them. While she was still concerned about if she was hiding things still, she chose to accept it and believe her love would let her know in time. She would give a sweet kiss in return, resting against her love for the time being.

&quot;Thank you, Ochi. I can&#39;t help but worry because I don&#39;t know the intricacies of your houses and I feel as though even if I remember my own I may be expected to give them up. I don&#39;t know what the future holds, but I want to spend it with you... Always.&quot;

She was trying to expressher own feelings as well, returning the tight hugs she kept her love held around her waist for a moment longer. It felt as though she should have shed a tear in this moment as she looked down and away for the moment. Seeing Ochi smile brought a smile to her own face as she mentioned a need to freshen up herself, earning a tilted head and a nod. 

&quot;I would like that. I will wait for you here, I suppose.&quot;</span>

The Yuan-ti Comeback with her eye patch on, and a clean face. she would draw a smile on her face. The kiss mark on her forehead totally disappeared. She would get closer to her woman and give her a warm kiss on her forehead, and Aniyah&#39;s head. She would take her right arm under her left, like a gentle noblewoman she is, and open the door of the cabin with her right hand. a ray of light would hit the face of the knight. She had a little hard time opening her eyes, it seems it was a bad idea to let the body transform two times; the first time was to give the update to her mother, she can&#39;t wait for the day she can control her transformation as she likes, without having to cover her eyes to pause it.   It took her a few seconds to get her clear vision back.

&quot;Goodness, This afternoon sun is pretty bright&quot; Which not &quot;Anyway, by what we should start ?&quot; She would ask herself with a low voice. &quot;What I am sure, is that we will avoid the military training ground, to not disturb the male soldiers... Let&#39;s start with a fishing place, it&#39;s a pretty relaxing place. Ochi next to Aniyah is like a lifeguard next to a Shinou royalty. A thing that the young knight would not mind, after the lifeguard, is in love with the Shinou princess.

Ochi would lead Anyah toward the fishing spot, in a slow step, as if nothing was waiting for them. she would look in the direction of Shinou. &quot;You know that we are a few miles from your lands. I can&#39;t wait to explore it, walk to the nearest town and enjoy the hot spring&quot; She says those words with lustful eyes before she snapped back &quot;I wonder if there were someone who would recognize you there, a good someone&quot; She would lower her gaze toward her fiance, to see her opinion about her words.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">She drew a smile on her lips in return as she brought herself to meet Ochi halfway, hugging her tight for a moment. It was reassuring that her love always took her worries into account, allowing her to relax a bit for now. She still felt the stress of meeting so many new people at once as they were people who ment so much to Ochi, but with her love&#39;s encouragement it didn&#39;t show as well as making it more manageable. She gave Ochi&#39;s arm a loving squeeze as she escorted her out of the house, the sun making her blink and adjust to the change in brightness herself. 

She wondered briefly how they could disturb the male soldiers by visiting the training grounds, only to think about what  that might imply. She nodded about the sun after having to adjust a bit herself, readily agreeing with what her love had said and accepting that they would be going wherever Ochi wished to show her with no knowledge of the area herself. It didn&#39;t register what the two of them might look like, standing side by side with a bit of contrast. She looked up to Ochi as she explained they were a short ways away from what was once her homelands and expressed her excitement to see it, blushing bright at the mention of enjoying the hot spring there. Her mind had jumped quickly to the words of Oran and Artem&#237;da had told her about Ochi and their insinuations of her in the hotsprings, seeing the lustful eyes that caused her to further deepen red. 

&quot;That does sound quite nice. I do not believe we will find anyone who would recognize me however. At least not for a good reason. I don&#39;t remember ever going to a hotspring so it will be a new experience.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">&quot;We will be safe there,  The knight is ready to protect her princess&quot;

Ochi would continue leading the way toward the Fishing spot while hearing her fiance&#39;s words about their future journey to Shinou. she was glad that Aniyah was excited as she is, even if she showed some concern related to meeting people who may recognize her. It seemed that the knight was too optimistic, actually, she didn&#39;t mind if they met none, the land seemed large, and her house didn&#39;t play an important role in where they would head. Seeing her Aniyah situation, it&#39;s better to avoid meeting anyone who could know her.

Speaking of Shinou, Ochi stopped on this island to wait for her agent&#39;s answer about the place they would visit. She needed to make sure that the next Shinou town is safe and doesn&#39;t face any possible conflict or hostility toward the people of Shinou. Far away she could notice her cousin standing next to a man in black. Maybe one of her agents. Penelope would give a nod to the said person, and head toward the couple.

&quot;Captain!, Lady Aniyah!&quot; She bowed to both of them, then she turned toward Ochi &quot;There is the letter you were waiting for&quot; she said to Ochi. The knight would reply with a nod first &quot;Thank you&quot; She opened the paper and started reading it. She would draw a smile &quot;So there are no changes then, okay&quot; She would hand the paper back. &quot;We will be at the fishing spot,&quot; Ochi said.
&quot;Alright, I will continue my duty&quot;</span>

She gently squeezed Ochi&#39;s arm as a small, discreet show of affection, wanting to show she appreciate the sweet words. As far as she was concerned, it would be best not to run into anyone who knew her as she was still concerned about the situation from the catacombs as well as the fact it would seem rather rude to not be able to remember someone from her past. 

&quot;Thank you, Elis&#225;vet. You&#39;ve always done well to protect me when you can and I do appreciate it greatly.&quot;

She knew they had to wait for the confirmation of them going to Shinou as to not cause any trouble, leaving little question when she saw Penelope talking with the darkly clad man. While she wondered who the man was that had caught Penelope&#39;s attention, she knew better than to ask with no discretion as it would pose problems for Ochi&#39;s cousin. She gave a small nod and smile to Penelope in return as she greeted them, listening to the quick conversation that transpired. 

&quot;Always a pleasure, Penelope. Thank you.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ochi would draw a wide smile on her face, after Aniyah thanked her for taking care of every detail regarding the trip, including their security. And to be honest, Ochi enjoys receiving praise mainly from her fiance. she would extend her hand over her head and give her a gentle head pet. passing her finger over the white hair of the little Shinou yuan-tin, and keeping happy eye contact with her. 

&quot;Anything for my dear princess, so no need to thank me, as your wife, I need to take care of everything to make our life easy&quot;

she would take back her hand gently and give a quick not to Penelope. It seems that the cousins don&#39;t need to exchange a lot of words to transmit an order or a message, they seem that they have trained to do that all their life. Maybe one day she would teach her ways of communication to Aniyah, it would be useful if they went together on a quest. Penelope would give a bow a to Aniyah before dismissing 

&quot;Shall we continue our walk?&quot; Ochi said to Aniyahn before she took the lead again. The fishing spots it&#39;s pretty near, a few meters ahead. There were some soldiers enjoying their time, but they empty the place when they notice Ochi getting closer. Don&#39;t seem  like their place was taken, but a gest of hospitality. One of the fishermen welcomed the two Yuan-ti with fishing rods.

&quot;Welcome Captain! Welcome young lady! do you need some rods to fish with&quot;
&quot;A yes, thank you&quot;
&quot;You are welcome, feel free to take some bait for bucket&quot;
Ochi would nod to the man and pick the free corner where she can sit with her fiance.
&quot;Tell me darling, do you know how to fish, or you want me to teach you?&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ochi&#39;s wide smile earned Ochi a smile in return, glad she could make her fiance happy in return. She always worried she would be seen as a burden most days, however that smile eased her mind quite a bit about the subject. Her words made a soft blush cross her cheeks, unused to the nickname and wanting to help.

&quot;Perhaps I can help next time. We are to be partners, are we not? You don&#39;t have to do it all on your own for our lives to be easy.&quot;

She let them finish their encounter with the slight tilt of her head, curious with the lack of words needed for their communication. She gave Penelope a respectful nod, nodding to Ochi&#39;s question of if they should continue their walk as she continued to be led around. The soldiers leaving left her puzzled as she watched them a moment, wondering if maybe the fishing spot wasn&#39;t big enough for them all before her gaze went to the fisherman who came with fishing rods, nodding respectfully and in affirmation. She settled in the free corner as she cuddled into Ochi&#39;s side, content with just being near her when she asked the question.

&quot;If I ever have, I dont remember. If you don&#39;t mind teaching me, I would like to learn.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ochi would hug Aniyah with her right hand while walking.  Indeed they need to protect each other mutually, but the knight&#39;s ego would not let her rely on her fiancee, but she appreciated what she said and her future effort. She would let a soft giggle come out of her mouth and scratch her head.

&quot;You are right, darling, but I start to have traditional husband energy, who do anything for his family&quot;

She enjoyed how her future wife caring for her, she can&#39;t see how her life without her could be now. But thanks to the quality, Ochi was getting more and more attached to this beautiful Yuan-ti. A Yuan-ti that made her accept herself, and accept her nature as a Yuan-ti. After all, she passed the transition exercises for her so she can protect Aniyah from any upcoming danger. But may the saying that one hand doesn&#39;t clap works also in a relationship.

Back to the Fishing spot, it wasn&#39;t a big one indeed, like it wasn&#39;t prepared for large-scale fishing, but more to relax between training and work. The couple could even hear people talking about the enlargement of this island as a long-dated project, but they waited for Shinou replay, to avoid any potential problem between the two nations. 

&quot;Alright I will teach you, look closely, first we prepare our rod&quot;

Ochi would take to the rod, start examining the fishing line. It seems that she is examining the quality of it. then she would hold the bait and show it closely to Aniyah. &quot;We start by preparing the bait&quot; she would take one of the worms in the bucket, and dress the bit with it. &quot;Now that it&#39;s ready, now we move to the hard part, which is how to put your fingers.&quot;  She would put her finger between the line and the wooden part. &quot;It&#39;s to have close contact with the line. She rises up the rod making a ninety-degree angle. with a swift move, she throws the line using the rod. &quot;And now we wait&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">She appreciated the hug while they were walking, understanding that she wished to make her life easier though she wished to do the same. A thoughtful look came over her face as she wondered what she could do in return, her attention quickly grabbed by her giggling fiance. Her words made her pierce her lips for a moment before a sly smile graced her lips.

&quot;If you&#39;d do anything for your family then you wouldn&#39;t mind me helping to make life easier for you as well. If we work together than we will have that much more time together, will we not?&quot;

She looked up at Ochi with a mischievous glint in her eye, excited to hear her response to her own logic. It wasn&#39;t just spending time for them to work together, but also in eachothers arms like they undoubtedly would spend at the hot springs. She silently hoped there might be a more private section so she might show Ochi something without fear, wanting to show her love her body without the wrappings and hoping she&#39;d love her the same as now.

She listened intently to the lesson Ochi gave her, copying her as she was shown what to do with her own rod. It took her a moment to get the bait on the hook as and find the way to hold it so she could cast the line. When she cast it, the line ended up closer than she would&#39;ve liked, her movements clumsy for her first time.

&quot;I think I did it?&quot;

She cuddled up to Ochi as she looked up for confirmation, preferring to keep close to her rather than actually caring to fish.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ochi&#225;asim&#233;nia can&#39;t remove her eyes from the pure face of her fiance. Especially after hearing how she wants to invest in their relationship as well,  by helping her to protect and serve their family. She would pray their relationship will be strange until the end of time. She would pet her soft white hair and reply to her question.

&quot;I will not stop you, if you find pleasure in it, go for it... but always keep me updated, so maybe I can provide advice if needed to solve any kind of struggle. and vice versa. Maybe your calm side and your wisdom may inspire me.&quot; She says with a soft voice, with eyes full of stars. &quot;But most importantly, trust each other, both of us still hide secrets, especially me... but I hope you would be patient with me&quot;  

  Back to the fishing spot, the knight would follow with her eyes how the gentlewoman copied her movement. She was satisfied by Aniyah&#39;s first try. Aniyah was able to show how clever she was learning new things, Like when she tried teaching her language. She is still young after all and still starving for knowledge.

&quot;Good job... &quot;  While complimenting her, she would notice that the woman&#39;s rod started twitching already &quot;That was very fast&quot; she would put her rod on support and hug gently Anyah from behind, to give her the support she needed to handle the rod. &quot;Now the second part of the lesson started&quot; She would guide the woman&#39;s hands slowly to the exact place. &quot;So basically, you need to collect the line, so when you are alone, you try to fix your rod on the ground or a support, then start collecting the line.&quot; She would help her woman to fix the rod on a support, and guide her body and hands to the position points where she needed to start to collect the lines.

&quot;I can see the fish... it&#39;s a mullet &quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">She couldn&#39;t take her sapphire eyes off of Ochi when she looked down at her, glad she seemed to be willing to let her help out at least. The gentle petting Ochi gave her brought a blush to her cheeks, enjoying the affectionate gesture as she heard her love speak. She nodded with Ochi&#39;s words happily agreeing with her.

&quot;We can work together to create the life we wish for love. I dont want to hide anything from you and I dont wish for you to feel the need to hide anything from me. I care deeply for you and it makes me feel bad to know you were hiding things from me. And while I will always be patient with you, love, I dont wish to feel bad knowing you continue hiding things from me. I simply wish to be open with you.&quot;

She was a little disappointed with the first try, not exactly having what she wanted to happen though she didn&#39;t complain. Ochi&#39;s praise made her smile up to her before she felt tugging at her rod already, surprising her and causing her to tighten her grip on the rod. When she was helped to situate her rod correct as Ochi hugged her from behind, she relaxed against Ochi a bit before following her instructions. She let Ochi guide her body and rod to show her what to do, a deep blush crossing her pale cheeks.

&quot;Umm... Ochi? After this, could we go back to the house for a moment? I wish to show you something and I&#39;m unsure if there will be a proper time later...&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ochi tried her best to hide her facial emotion from her lover&#39;s words, she never felt so much wanted and loved with passion. to a point she felt like she was in a dream that she never wanted to wake up from, never wake up from. Sometimes she thinks about dropping her military career to retire to someplace far away from her, so she can build a peaceful future with her. But the knight tried to not be selfish, and try to manage time for her duty and new build family. 

She would notice the face of disappointment on her fianc&#233;e&#39;s face but she knew no one expected perfection from the first time. Ochi had always failed to catch her first fish, but never gave up because she loved fishing, it used to be her copping for ages. A way to forget about her complicated life. She would keep helping her girl to catch her fish and take it with her hand. The fish didn&#39;t stop twitching on her hand until she dropped it in a bucket and sealed it. 

&quot;That was some strong boy, let see if I will have the same luck as you&quot; she would draw a warming smile on her face. Then she switched her focus to her fishing rod, which started moving as well, after a few minutes from capturing the first fish. The knight jumped on the rod and captured the same kind of fish in a spectacular way showing off her fishing talent. After capturing the fish, her attention switched to Aniyah&#39;s question.</span>

&quot;Sure, my love&quot; She started to get intrigued by what her companion wanted to show her, also she felt that it could be the best time to show her new power to her lover. &quot;Let&#39;s bring those fishes to Pen, then let&#39;s home&quot; Ochi started leading the way, and gave back the rods to the male soldiers. On their way back to the house, she would meet Penelope walking around with her brother. &quot;Hi, Pen, could you bring those fishes to the cook&quot; With no hesitation, Penelope took the bucket and continued her march with the Major. Ochi would lead her girl to the house again. Ochi would take a seat expecting something important that let Aniyah have the burning feeling to show her what she had.

&quot;I&#39;m lessening&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">While her face hadn&#39;t particularly shown her feelings, her eyes had shown her care in them and let her let down the facade that she kept around others. She had realized with Hoklathi that she had harder to explain feelings and felt more than the man who seemed to only think of her as a potential pawn with his teachings. With Ochi, she never felt on edge even when she could be  a bit overbearing and quick to push forward with plans she seemed to concoct.

The warm smile and help from Ochi to bring in the fish made her smile, eventually having the flopping fishing her hands before sealing it in the bucket. When her love switched her attention to her rod and it started to twitch, she wrapped her arms around Ochi&#39;s waist in a tight hug. In her mind she was terrified to show her, but needed to now that she&#39;d asked. She enjoyed watching Ochi&#39;s skill as she captured a similar fish, hearing her agree for them to go back to the house for a bit. 

She nodded to agree that they should bring their catch away, happy to have been helpful in that they&#39;d both caught one. Ochi handed the bucket to Penelope and she briefly wondered if they&#39;d just caught their own meal for the night before they made their way to the house again. Ochi would take her seat and bring her attention to Aniyah, confirming that she was listening and bringing her into a nervous feeling, glancing around a little.

&quot;I will be back in one moment...&quot;

With her hurried words she stepped quickly to the bathroom, breathing hard for someone who didn&#39;t need to. She would start to disrobe until she got to her bindings, hesitating for a moment before removing them as well and exposing the patches of goblin-like skin in places on her scales.</span>

With that she stepped out with her eyes to the ground, stepping where Ochi could see the patches and moving her hair over her shoulder to reveal the bigger one.

&quot;This is why I always wear the bindings.... you saw one before but you hadn&#39;t seen the extent of which pieces of me are missing...&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Sitting in her place, she accepted Aniyah&#39;s request to take her moment in the bathroom. She would still wonder what she wanted to share with her. She feels less stressed about what her woman would tell her than the idea that Ochi needs to share more of her secrets. She would stand up to get herself some water, and bring an additional glass for Aniyah, she may be thirsty as well. Ochi would come back to her place with a plat of goblets and a jug of water, and serve the first goblet to herself, and start sipping from it. While drinking, her eyes got wide seeing Aniyah Half-naked.  She choked on her goblet before making a little cough. She was surprised indeed, but for different reasons. After hearing Aniyah&#39;s words, the knight would stand up and get close to her fianc&#233;e. She would offer to her a caress on her face followed up by a kiss.

&quot;I love you for who you are, not for how you look... I will not lie that I was expecting to see that, when we were not together, I took time to read about what people reported about the undead&quot;  The Noblewoman grabbed Aniyah&#39;s hand, and kissed her on the ring she gifted her. &quot;That ring was the answer to every question you may have.&quot; She would end her honeyed words with a hug. &quot;But the real question is, are you ready to see what I hide behind this flower?&quot; She would point toward her eye patch.


Ochi would release Aniyah and take some steps back. She would start by removing her metallic armor, which she removed only during bedtime. Starting by the shoulders, then the arm, followed by the legs. The stripping was slowly, full of hesitation. Aniyah could hear from her stand that Ochi started to have a hard time breathing and began to sweat. It&#39;s the third time she did that on the same day, she was afraid that she was stuck for the day. She would remove the main part of the armor. Letting herself only wear her usual training robe. She took another sip of the water before taking out her robe and underwear.</span>

Eyes that become more snake-like. She would take a deep breath. Her hair transformed to white snake hair. her body starts to get covered with silvery scales. Her lover&#39;s body becomes like lamia&#39;s lower part, a magistice snake tail. After the transformation should bake a bow to Aniyah, with a sad snake voice. 

&quot;My name didn&#39;t change, Ochi&#225;asim&#233;nia was my birth name after all. As the elder, in my obligation to become an abomination. My hate for those is real and refused to become one. But I did that to be able to protect the one I love, and live together for a longer time... Please forgive me for not sharing my decision earlier... it was selfish on my part&quot; Her snake started beating hard afraid of being rejected. But she wanted to clarify everything before the day of the marriage.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">She saw Ochi choke a bit on her water when she came out, raising a worried hand out to her before she started to cough and recover. The wide eyes suggested she hadn&#39;t expected this, making Aniyah internally a bit happy that she could surprise Ochi. She leaned into the gentle caress, wrapping her arms around Ochi&#39;s neck as she indulged in the kiss. 

She heard her love&#39;s words and tilted her head, wondering what she had learned and what had been reported. It was a leap of trust to show Ochi what she was now, having an inherent distaste for the patches of skin that simply didn&#39;t belong. That she was taking it so well made her feel quite relieved, the question she posed bringing forth a deep curiosity.

&quot;It is more I am showing you the things I dislike about my own body. I know you love me just as I love you. You&#39;re the only one I&#39;ve shown my patched skin to...&quot;

She would pay her undivided attention to Ochi, a curious glean to her eyes as she watcher her love remove her armor. A soft blush crossed her cheeks as her thought went somewhere they shouldn&#39;t have in such a serious moment, leaving her holding a breath she didn&#39;t need. She would hear the labored breath and see her hesitation, wondering what would cause Ochi to seem to worry. Her blush would deepen as Ochi stripped further before saying something about her true form, unsure what that could mean.

&quot;I-I don&#39;t mind it either way.&quot;

She watched as Ochi&#39;s body changed immensely, becoming like a lamia and gorgon. Her mouth would open slightly in awe, eyes wide as she started at the silvery scales before meeting those newly snake-like eyes and giving her a soft smile.</span>

[Aellina]&quot;Is that why you reacted the way you did when I first mentioned them and called them as such? Oh Ochi... Its hard for anyone to protect someone who is being reckless. I am not made you made this decision on your own. It was yours to make, not mine. I love you for you, Ochi&#225;asim&#233;nia.&quot;

She stepped over to Ochi, wrapping her arms loosely around her waist and smiling up at her. This was the openness she wanted from her love and there was no way she would turn her back on Ochi when such trust was returned.

&quot;The only thing I&#39;ve truly hid from you is that I took some extra classes at the university so you didn&#39;t have to work so hard teaching me the language. I didn&#39;t tell you because I loved spending the extra time with you.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ochi would hug Aniyah very tight but gently, she doesn&#39;t want to harm but she wants to feel her love. She would let some tear drops from her eyes, tears of happiness and sadness. She is happy that Aniyah forgives the mistake that she made, by earning an abomination form. And sad because she regretted that decision all the time. This day, Ochi would cry for the first time. Aniyah could feel the snake woman&#39;s body getting warmer. She would release her companion after hugging her for minutes until she calmed down.   She started cleaning her face, and took a deep breath. She would grab the goblet from the table and finish the last drop of water left in. She takes a deep breath, letting her body come back to normal. 

[Aellina] &quot;I didn&#39;t to myself I will not lie to myself, but my love for you was my inspiration, and this love made me accept myself and not run away from it.&quot;

While talking she didn&#39;t notice that she took her human form back, with scales still in her arms, and on her back, more scales than before. but the knight didn&#39;t mind at all. The only part of her body she got ashamed of was the second cock that she grows after her third transformation, She would jump directly to her panties then her robe to get proper again in front of her woman.

&quot;Goddess, I cried today like a human child... but it felt good... I guess&quot; She would draw a smile on her face &quot;Thank you for being part of my life, thank you for letting me show off my feelings and be all weak in front of you. &quot;
She started to feel awkward in front of Aniyah not knowing what she would do. She would come back to her seat and call her woman to join her, they could simply coddle and see how to finish their afternoon until dinner time.  her eyes would draw on Aniyah&#39;s eyes once again, the young woman could read the remaining of regret feeling on Ochi&#39;s eyes. But most importantly, she can see both eyes after a while.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">She returned the tight hug it seemed her love needed desperately, offering all the comfort she could. She felt the tears drop to her skin and moved to wipe them from her love&#39;s eyes, holding her face with a soft smile for a moment before bringing her back into the comforting embrace. It was new to see Ochi cry for her and she felt her love become warmer, wondering briefly what would cause that before Ochi released her and gathered herself. She would carefully refill the goblet that she drained of the last few drops, a soft caring smile on her face as she gently insisted her love drink some more water to try and calm her. 

&quot;I&#39;ve always accepted you for who you are. What you look like doesn&#39;t dictate who you are though it seems you have more control now that you aren&#39;t hiding it, yes? Is that what the flower did?&quot;

She admired her knight&#39;s new scales a moment before her eyes trailed down, a bright blush appearing across her face as she saw the second member that had appeared. Seeing how quickly Ochi went to get dressed concerned her, unsure of what feelings would constitute such a response when it was only the two of them. 

&quot;You are never weak Ochi. You would allow the same of me I would hope. If it felt good that is what matters. It means you needed to.&quot;

Aniyah stepped lythly to her seat next to Ochi, disregarding her state of undress as her face returned to its normal pale skin. She didn&#39;t mind being exposed to her love even without her bindings as she cuddled up to Ochi&#39;s side, showing the knight just how comfortable she made her and hoping that she truly didn&#39;t mind the patched skin that was once her alabaster scales.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ochi can&#39;t help herself from following Aniyah with her eyes, following every movement of her. The way the Shinouan woman cared about her, made her feel more human. After all, she wasn&#39;t a full Yuanti, But with the ritual, she became a full one. The ritual didn&#39;t make her reject all her emotions but made her accept them more, and only show them to the person who cared for them. It&#39;s more a private thing to keep and present to the public with the usual ruthless face.  Following Aniyah&#39;s hands purring to her more water, it seems that she felt that the knight may need more water.

&quot;Mhm&quot; She would take a sip of the water &quot;The patched eye was the key to this new power and as part of my last examination, I should learn how to control it. The way varies from one member to another. The general has... doesn&#39;t matter&quot; she assumed it wasn&#39;t important  &quot;What&#39;s is matter is I can use my both eyes, but I will keep the eye patch for now, until I give my final report to my mother&quot;

She would accept her fiance&#39;s cuddle and reward her with more kisses. As Aniyah accepted her abomination, Ochi didn&#39;t mind how her woman&#39;s skin looked. She finds it quite charming and unique. But she wonders if she could help Aniyah more, to leave her undead state. She wondered if she could bring her old body back, but she doesn&#39;t want to force anything on her. She would keep searching around, and wait until Ani gets tired of being reborn.

&quot;Thank my love, your words mean everything&quot;</span>

It made her happy that her love was comfortable enough to show her her emotions, showing how true her feelings were for her and reaffirming her own. She listened patiently to what Ochi was willing to explain, a soft and supportive smile on her face. She tilted her head curiously at her words about the general and opting to keep the eye patch for now, unsure as to why she needed it when it seemed as though she had plenty of control.

&quot;I see. I believe I understand better now, though what is the need for the eye patch now that you have control? I wish to understand fully so I can better support you. I dont want you to feel the need to hide anything from me anymore.&quot;

She enjoyed cuddling with Ochi and her hand gently made its way under Ochi&#39;s tunic and to the bare skin on her waist, her cool touch making small patterns on her skin. She&#39;d found a few pieces and replaced the skin, looking over the place it&#39;d been grafted back.

&quot;You mean everything to me, Ochi.&quot;

It&#39;s looking pretty isn&#39;t&quot; Ochi would put her eye patch on her face. she would summon one snake hair out of her head, then start petting it &quot;Also my new hair reminds me a lot of Ako, and you... well, this one is the closest to your snake in the look, and it&#39;s weird to have other creatures linked to you.&quot; Ochi would let herself be carried as always with her talk. But It seems that she gets passionate when she starts explaining things to Aniyah.

&quot;Tell me... do you wish to stay in this room until dinner time, or do you want to walk... to be honest, we  didn&#39;t be so intimate for a while&quot;

She would simply keep the Shinounan woman between her arms, playing with her silky hair. She would enjoy looking at Aniyah&#39;s innocent-looking face, letting herself enjoy some silent moment with her, hearing the movement of water outside.

&quot;I am over you.
Then my eyes meet yours once more,
and I fall in love.&quot;

She would mumble some poem she used to hear being read by the woman of Sofia.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">She smiled as she listened to her love explain and worry about it looking pretty, accepting that she just simply wasn&#39;t comfortable with it yet. She placed a soft kiss under the eyepatch before placing another on her other cheek as well. Seeing that she was able to summon pieces of that other form sparked some curiosity as she listened to Ochi admit it felt strange to her, not quite understanding with always having Oku. 

&quot;I find it quite comforting most days. Oku is never truly far away from me with that, but I imagine its a bit different when they&#39;re connected to your person.&quot;

She heard Ochi&#39;s question and admission to which she&#39;d obviously prefer, a soft blush crossing her face before she brought her lips to Ochi&#39;s. Her eyes fluttered closed as she kept her lips for a long moment, offering her love a silent answer even as their lips parted. 

&quot;I believe I would prefer to stay in for a while. Its not as if I can go out looking like this after all.&quot;

She gestured to her naked form with a dismissive hand, enjoying being in Ochi&#39;s arms. Her love playing with the alabaster silk of her hair made her smile as she relaxed against her, her hand finding its way under the fabric of Ochi&#39;s tunic and rubbing the bare skin of her side. Her love was right about them not having been intimate for some time, having focused on her studies while Ochi did her duties as a knight. She was quite eager for some time with Ochi.

She would take her by the chin and give her a passionate kiss, a kiss that reminded her of their first time. she would let her tongue dance with hers. After all the feelings that they shared today, she felt it was pretty rewarding. After that she enjoyed the kiss, letting some sugary saliva drip from her tongue. She would start licking her partner&#39;s neck, like a cat clearing their significant other&#39;s fur. She would enjoy every inch of the undead skin, with the fact that her body has multiple types of skins, gave her a different taste that Ochi enjoyed so far.

She would let her right-hand caress Aniyah&#39;s skin, fetching for the woman&#39;s breast. But she wanted to let her partner enjoy every touch. She wasn&#39;t sure if the Shinouan woman was ready for making love. By the way, they coddled each other, and the way they stayed half naked made the knight crave some mating. Also, she wanted to try how the double cock felt. She kept licking and feeling the woman with kisses, waiting for her reaction.

&quot;I wanted to wait until we arrived at Shinou, to have fun next to a hot spring, but I crave you like a thirsty beast right now.&quot; 

She would unleash her other hand to help the other to hold the undead beauty, and made her comfortable on the bed. The knight started to undress again, her partner more comfortable, and not being the only one naked. She would expose her perfectly built body, with new additions on it.  She would keep licking until she arrived at the breast and started sucking them.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">She easily fell into the passionate kiss her love pulled her into, their tongues dancing together sweetly as they so easily found eachother&#39;s rhythm. A soft whimper escaped her as their lips parted and that passionate dance of their tongues ceased, soft moans escaping her as Ochi&#39;s tongue found its way to her neck to lick and tease her. She leaned into the attention as she tilted her head for Ochi&#39;s playful links. Her hands searched under her lover&#39;s tunic, decidingly removing the garment before returning the caresses as she panted. 

One hand trailed down to gently caress her love&#39;s covered cocks, blushing bright as she bit her lip and moved to straddle Ochi. She wanted to leave no doubt in the other&#39;s mind to just how much she wanted her, even if she was a bit nervous. It was a question to her partner that now there was two, where would the second go? Having never considered such a situation before, it hadn&#39;t been something she&#39;d thought on. 

&quot;Why can&#39;t we do both? We can have all of each other here and now as well as then. Unless there&#39;s business that needs attended to.... Ochi I want you.&quot;

She allowed herself to be laid out on the bed, looking up to Ochi before starting to help her love undress, enjoying the wonton way they both seemed to throw time to the wind. Aniyah herself wouldn&#39;t be remiss if they ended up late for dinner, the occasion mostly being for appearances and social for herself. She let her hands roam over Ochi&#39;s well-built body as she moaned and gasped under her lover&#39;s teasing tongue.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ochi missed the taste of her lover&#39;s flesh, but with all the recent related to her transformation, Ochi felt like her lust becomes lower than before. Maybe all her lustful energy went to Aniyah. But she is glad that she had another time to have intimate moments. When Aniyah&#39;s hand started caressing her crotch, she would bite her own lower lip. She would keep sucking on Aniyah&#39;s gentle breast, and biting it gently, enjoying the moans. After getting satisfied, she would lower her tongue to the woman&#39;s crotch.

&quot;I really missed your taste, but with the way you moved your hands, I believe you want to taste them as well&quot;

She would slowly remove her panties accompanied by her snake tongue until she reached Aniyah&#39;s vaginal lips. They still look the same, but with more wonderful smells. Without hesitation, she starts eating her out. She would lick all her juices, make her inside be filled with Ochi&#39;s juices. She can&#39;t wait to dig in, but she preferred as always to go slow on her. the knight would remove her head so she can have time to remove her underwire feeling that her cocks will rip it off. She would present two cocks, the Yuan-ti never had the chance to play with them, so gave the honor to Aniyah.

&quot;You can taste them with your mouth darling, to see how they feel. because I will fill you up with them&quot;

She would draw a smirk on her face, inviting her woman to explore the body of the Illiyhian Noble. She would sit on the bed, her legs wide open. waiting for her fiance to claim the second cock. She would start imagining their first time together in her Anyassian bathroom.</span>

It hadn&#39;t escaped her that Ochi bit her lip when she&#39;d begun to caress her crotch, wondering if it was from nerves or arousal for just a moment before continuing to caress her, only a moments hesitation to think. She gave a little nod as Ochi&#39;s tongue made its way to her thin little panties and she heard her love&#39;s words, confirming that she would like to taste Ochi as well.

&quot;Ochi~&quot;

She wasn&#39;t going to deny she wished to explore her partner&#39;s body and make her feel good, the second cock being a curiosity to her though she wasn&#39;t going to mention it to Ochi as to not risk making her self-conscious. Her love&#39;s name left her lips eagerly as she felt her love&#39;s tongue on her lower lips, her body shivering in pleasure a moment as Ochi lapped at her juices eagerly. She watched intently as Ochi removed her underwear and presented them to her, the permission given in short haste before she found herself moving to be inbetween her legs.

She wasted little time as she gently took one in each hand, stroking them for a moment before taking her tongue to the first&#39;s tip. She suckled playfully on the tip and swirled her tongue around it, taking her deeper as she turned her eyes to Ochi&#39;s face. A blush crossed her cheeks as she serviced her love eagerly, switching between the two cocks infront of her and licking playfully along the underside of each when she switched

Last time she was shy, because it was her first time together, exploring each other. But today, even though she was excited, she seems to be scared. After all, it&#39;s the first time Ochi is using her second penis so she would do her best to go easy on her. She would fix her seat a little bit and give a head pat to her.

&quot;There, there... I will go easy with you, I will let you be in charge for a little bit until you get comfortable... there is no rush&quot;

Ochi has no problem reaching pleasure, but it would be better if it was shared between them. She was glad that her lover took her time,  she hoped that she was enjoying what she was saying. The moment when her lover touched the second, Ochi would let a feminine moan get out of her mouth. She felt her second meat felt so sensitive as if the nerves were brand new. A thing that gave her a new kind of pleasure. The sensation on the first one was pretty good but intense enough to let her lose herself.

&quot;By the Goddess, I never knew that a fresh one could feel that way. your mouth made feel good&quot;

Ochi&#39;s face became all red, she would let herself lean back to the bed, and relax. She would feel herself being all eaten by Aniyah. She would throw glances from time to time toward her girl, before turning her head, gazing toward the roof. She is not in the state of orgasm yet, but they feel so soft right now. She would start to play with her breast.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">-Feeling the soft head pats and comforting words from her love makes her look up, realizing quickly that her emotions must be showing through at least some for Ochi to realize she was a bit nervous for there to be two now. She smiled up at Ochi as she heard her, watching her reactions to how she explored what was now infront of her. Seeing how much more Ochi seemed to feel with the second and focused her tongue on the sensitive gland, stroking the first as she sucked on the second. 

She heard Ochi&#39;s words and led her on in her pleasure, letting her lean back and enjoy for the time being. Seeing Ochi begin to tease at her own breasts, a soft blush crossing her face as she climbed up to straddle her lover. Her slick, warm lips slid across her shaft with ease as she rolled her hips, eagerly awaiting more of Ochi&#39;s pleased moans that she hoped to garner.

&quot;Ochi... I want you~&quot;

She bit her lip as she lined up one with her slit, feeling the other tap at her little rose bus making her blush further. A moment of steeling her resolve and she rubbed the tip of the second against her impossibly tight hole, looking to prepare herself for what was next and hoping this might be what Ochi had in mind. Slowly she worked to relax and let her lover deeper inside her, taking it a little at a time as she looked down at Ochi.

&quot;I-Is this ok?&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ochi started to feel that her brain would explode with the way her lover sucked her second organ. She kept resisting her moan harder, she didn&#39;t want her voice to leave the wooden house. She wants to let everything that happened in the room stay in the room unless someone felt the lustful exchange they had. She would keep watching her lover enjoying herself, and doing her best to please her companion. After a moment of nirvana, she would feel that Aniyah stopped stroking after she mentioned that she wants her. She would raise her head a little to see and notice that Aniyah is trying to ride. The knight would give a little smirk enjoying what she sees. She would try to gather her force, so she can her fianc&#233;e to perform the position that she had in mind.

&quot;It&#39;s okay darling, but let me assist a little bit.&quot; 

She would help her lover to guide the fresh cock, in her vaginal lips and insert the original cock on the woman&#39;s anal hole. She would feel that she sees a little bit tight on the other side. Ochi would put two of her fingers on her mouth to moisturize it with her saliva, which became a little bit thick, which would help better. she would let Aniyah lean her chest, so she can apply the liquid down there, and tease it.  Then she would let both snakes penetrate Aniyah slowly. (I assume Aniyah went to go cowgirl)

&quot;I believe you are ready&quot; 

Ochi would move slowly inside her woman, it was her first time with double penetration, so she doesn&#39;t want to break her lover. She would grab Aniyah&#39;s ass and start to move it slowly. So far it felt so good, and an enjoyable experience, but she expects to have a break after they come. She kept the same rhythm of grinding waiting for permission to get faster and deeper.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">She wanted to give her lover as much pleasure as possible and pull the moans she seemed to be holding back from her throat, not caring who might hear the lustful acts. Her only concern of note might be the fact her wounds and patched skin was on display for anyone to see if they were to walk in on the couple, the issue being eclipsed by the small Yuan-ti&#39;s need to please Ochi as she looked up at her. The smirk she recieved with the clumsy attempt to ride her love made her cheeks grow red, tucking her chin a little in a bit of embarrassment at her own over eagerness.

She nodded to Ochi&#39;s offer of helping her with the new situation for the two of them, a soft moan escaping her as the fresh cock slipped inside her slick pussy. It made her feel a bit better that Ochi seemed to realize the problem with putting the second in, her blush deepening as she watched her love coat her fingers to prepare Aniyah for what was to come next. She leaned forward into her lover, feeling how she prepared her body before feeling even more full and letting out a long moan as she was fully impaled on the two cocks. It was two firsts for her at one leaving her overwhelmed with the new feelings.

&quot;Ochi...I love you...&quot;

The words left her in a soft panting as she felt each slow thrust inside her body, slowly getting used to all the new sensations and the fullness she felt. Her body moved with a little insistence from Ochi, having been distracted by how her body felt for a moment and again as they both moved at the slow pace her lover set. She bit her lip and nodded to her love, a silent way to tell her she was ok before more moans escaped her lips into the room. 

&quot;I-I can take more... I feel so full...&quot;

Ochi would keep moving inside of her lover until she felt that it was safe for both of them to go harder. The knight is a beast when it comes to sex, but when it comes to someone with who she would finish her life, she would prefer to preserve her. Ochi would let her soft moans escape as well when warmth embraced the fresh organ. She would feel even better that she wishes that this lustful contact would last forever, and never break.

When she starts to feel more confident about her performance. She would take Aniyah&#39;s ass with a firm grip, but gentle still. She would manipulate the woman&#39;s body patiently, with a clear focused expression on her face as if it was a training weight. She would coat her roods with juices, at a medium speed, looking if her future wife is ready to go for further speed. She would hope that she would not that fast yet, she still wants to enjoy her time.

So far the Yuan-ti is enjoying her early honeymoon, she never enjoyed traveling so far, and she can wait to arrive at the final destination. But like the old sage said, &quot;Enjoy every bit of the journey.&quot;   The Knight is really happy to see that her partner is having the time of her life, for a small person, she knows how to enjoy her time. Looking at the face of pleasure.

&quot;If you want to go harder, I will go full beast,&quot; She says with a smirk on her face.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ochi&#39;s words made her bite her lip for only a moment before another thrust brought a moan from her throat into the room, the constant moving seeming to stimulate her far more than she was used to. The soft moans that she heard from Ochi were satisfying and brought her to lean into her lover a moment, her body needing a small reprieve. This wasn&#39;t truly how she thought this evening would go, having more expected her love to be somewhat unnerved by the goblinesque skin that broke up her own alabaster scales. She was certainly happier with the outcome, not having had much time to be like this with Ochi and it also left them both to accept eachother fully.

She felt the firm grip on her ass as Ochi moved to lead her movements a bit with more confidence, her own hands going to her love&#39;s shoulders as she was manipulated to please her partner. A moment later she brought her face down to capture one of Ochi&#39;s nipples in her mouth to suck on as one hand went to knead the other, slowly growing more confident herself in what she was doing. She easily coated her love&#39;s rods as they thrust through her body, growing slicker each moment as she became more comfortable with the feeling of being overfilled.

The early honeymoon was being greatly enjoyed in this new journey, shown by her swirling tongue and suckling on her love&#39;s breast. Her playfully pinching fingers lightly tugging at the nipple between them as she experimented with what might make Ochi moan louder, her body squeezing around both thrusting rods as she slowly climbed to the peak of her pleasure. The suggestion of her love going full beast confused her as she&#39;d never heard this from her love before, bringing her gaze back to meet Ochi&#39;s with a slight look of confusion.

&quot;W-what do you mean?... ah....&quot;

She never felt that way during sex, or maybe she had it during her first time, but she couldn&#39;t remember. But her sensitive member doesn&#39;t do her justice, she is afraid that she could come at any moment. But she is confident about her sexual skill. She would draw a grin on her face when she sees her lover reaching for her breast, the little Aniya looks really like a baby reaching for the breast. She would wonder if she can lactate, especially that she can&#39;t get pregnant herself, her mother once confirmed to her that she cannot conceive one inside of her. A fact that never bothered her, because never expected that she could meet a man or fall in love with him, or even a hermaphrodite,  but she had no feelings for the one she met before, besides lust.

&quot;Maybe it would be a bad idea, I don&#39;t want to break your body&quot;

 She replied to Aniyah, first of all, she needs to learn how to appreciate this new double penetration, make an enjoyable new experience for both of them.

&quot;It&#39;s just some lustful idea I had, we still need to save some energy to join the dinner table...ah... even if I have the feeling that they will figure out what happens between us&quot;    

Ochi would recall her after sex soft side, something that goes away after a relationship, thank to how sleepy she gets, but it is still early evening, and the knight doesn&#39;t feel tired yet. She would raise a rhythm a little bit but not too hard. When she notices that little yuan-ti let her breast, should pause to give a deep kiss to Aniyah.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">She was trying to understand what her love ment through the sexual haze that clouded her mind, seeing the changing expression that made her a little curious. The two new feelings left her mind scattered and trying to understand as her moans escaped her, her body squeezing around her lover&#39;s members with each thrust. She was leaning against Ochi&#39;s chest as she listened to her love talk herself out of the suggestion instead of explaining what she ment.

&quot;I&#39;m not so breakable, love.... I&#39;ve just never... heard you say that and don&#39;t know what you mean?&quot;

She was already greatly appreciating the new feelings and the passion behind her love&#39;s thrusts, if not a bit overwhelmed with the sensitive new feelings it brought to her. Her pleasure could be seen on her face as a heavy blush crossed her cheeks, panting a bit inbetween moans.

&quot;I dont care if they know... I want you Ochi. Take me however you wish, my love.&quot;

She pressed into the kiss sweetly as their tongues danced together, feeling her love go a little harder in her thrusts. However their evening continued wasn&#39;t too much of a concern to the young Yuan-ti woman, only that they spent it in eachothers presence.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ochi would grin when she heard Aniyah&#39;s confirmation that she is not an easily breakable wish to make her more confident about what she would do to her. She started to collect her words to explain what she wanted to do to her lover, but the situation started getting harder for her, because she started to feel that her balls will burst out soon, but she is not satisfied yet. she would take a deep breath, so she can take control of herself before voicing what she plans to do.

&quot;I meant by going harder, is that I want to get faster inside of you... from my....&quot; She would get cut with another moan    &quot;from my old experience is that not everyone enjoys it, only the strongest&quot; She would take a deep breath again while keeping the same rhythm &quot;But it seems I will leave it for our second round darling... I want you more... I&#39;m Still Hungry&quot;

She would keep trusting inside her lover, while having one of her best orgasmic sensations, something that she has rarely. But for good reason she is always with Aniyah, maybe her love for her made her enjoy her sexual relationships with her. She kept kissing her lover more and more, she couldn&#39;t get enough of those lips and her lover&#39;s tongue. forgetting about the outside world, she doesn&#39;t care if they stayed that way all night long even escaping the dinner.

&quot; Tell me when you are ready to come together&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The pleasure she was given had her a bit distracted even as she listened for her love&#39;s explanation of what she meant, excited to know Ochi&#39;s wishes of what she wanted to do. She was eager to please her love and the grin made her feel more confident in that ability, her body squeezing around both of the intruding members and cutting her own thoughts as she moaned. She watched as Ochi tried to gather herself before actually speaking, bringing a small smile to her own face. 

Her explanation of wanting to go harder and faster into her made her nod as she moaned at another thrust, worrying slightly about it as she&#39;d never truly been handled roughly by her partners. She bit her lip and nodded her understanding that it wasn&#39;t for everyone and was silently relieved that it would have to wait for the moment, already overwhelmed with the two firsts she was already experiencing. Hearing that Ochi wanted more still and that she was still hungry brought a bright blush across her face even as the room filled with the sounds of their love making and moans.

&quot;We could try... I still want you more Ochi... I feel so full Ochi...&quot;

Her mind was still screaming Ochi&#39;s name as she enjoyed each thrust that brought her closer to that orgasmic release she craved, made better by the love she had for her partner. The moment their lips met again it was Aniyah&#39;s turn to take some control as she reveled in the kiss, passion filling the kiss eagerly and she pressed into her love. She held Ochi tight as their tongues danced together, their lips parting for only a moment to let them speak.

&quot;I&#39;m close Ochi.&quot;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">She kept resisting for more, she started to feel that her mind would blow up from pleasure. She could feel her body starting to sweat, from all the action she is having. She felt like she needed a bath after that, or a nocturnal swim under the moon of the harbor. Even if it is a safe place, she can&#39;t escape the eyes of curious people. She knows that there are some blind spots that she could use later, but now it&#39;s just thinking about this moment of pleasure she is in. She kept thrusting for a few seconds before letting all her sperm load leave her balls after she felt that her love came as well.

She would lead Aniyah&#39;s body to the bed, to lay down, so she can pull out both her cocks slowly and smoothly. She would start to take a deep breath while watching her cooks all steamy and hard, still ready for another round. In a moment, Ochi would put her finger under her ears, like she is hearing or feeling something. Her gaze seems to fix one point on Aniyah&#39;s body, but not looking at something specific. She starts to nod with a grin on her face like she is hearing some good news.

&quot;Sorry, it&#39;s Pen. It seems like everyone is busy right now, and dinner will be postponed until midnight, which means it will be a prayer dinner... don&#39;t worry, I will explain everything to you later... For now, let have more fun I&#39;m not satisfied  yet as well&quot;       

She would go on the top of her lover and start kissing again, enjoying her flavorful lips, while her right hand is squeezing gently the yuan-ti breast.

&quot;Now darling I want to lay down on your stomach and raise your hips. Like if you&#39;re kneeling on your stomach... maybe you can&#39;t see me in this position, but you will feel me more.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Their sweat-slick bodies rubbed together in the heat of passion and being filled more than she ever had been easily combined to tip her over the edge, her body squeezing and milking her lover&#39;s cocks. There was no doubt in her mind that they will both need to wash up after all this, but it was somewhere in the far back of her mind in the moment as she was flooded by pleasure and her thoughts pushed away. She arched her back a bit as her body was flooded by her love&#39;s seed, filling her further while she looked up at Ochi through hooded eyes.

She felt the bed under her when Ochi laid her down, her body still trying to milk her lover as she slowly pulled herself free from her clutching  body and allowing a moment&#39;s reprieve. Looking down at the hard, cum-coated members made a bright blush cross her cheeks, a small smile joining her blush as she saw how ready her love was to continue. She&#39;d never seen Ochi zone out how she had next and that slightly concerned her, tilting her head until she heard the explanation.

&quot;I am sure everyone is quite busy. I know we are. Indulge in me as much as you want, love. I can not seem to get enough of you.&quot;

She leaned up into the heady kiss as she indulged in her love&#39;s lips, choosing to let her body control her actions in the moment. She wasn&#39;t used to having her mind out of the equation, but her lust overshadowed any thoughts she might have had and made the decision easy. Hearing her love&#39;s suggestion for their love making had her nodding, quite fond of the idea as she moved into a position on her hands an knees before tilting herself forward. She presented herself eagerly as she looked back at Ochi, breathing hard in her anticipation and showing both her recently filled holes.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ochi felt satisfied from her first cum inside of her lover, and from the news, she got from her cousin. She would admire her lover, her lover&#39;s body. Aniyah wasn&#39;t the sexiest woman Ochi ever met, but she was perfect for her taste. A petite body with athletic features, the ideal body of an adventurer. She would keep kissing her lover passionately for more until she is satisfied, she would take the chance to caress her lover&#39;s body every more. The scent, ah yes the scent coming out from the yuan-ti body is so intoxicating in a good way, that she doesn&#39;t want to stop having it on her nose.

&quot;You smell like heaven... my haven, that I don&#39;t want anyone to smell it beside me&quot;

She said with a wide smile on her face, showing off her dominant and possessive side with her words. She can&#39;t wait to have this woman as her official wife. She would watch the end executing her suggestion word by word, looking at the woman ass steaming and moving eagerly to have more love nectar inside of her. She would grab her ass and caress it slowly. She would clean the dripping juice from the woman&#39;s ass, before starting rubbing her cocks against her holes lips.

&quot;That&#39;s my wife! My good wife!&quot;

She pernitrate her cocks on the woman holes, slowly at first then she started moving her cock faster than she did the last time. Now that she empty her first load, she is not afraid to come faster this time. Ochi is glad for having better control this time, it makes her feel more comfortable. Her fucking didn&#39;t let to forget about her Montale discussion with Pen, it seemed to her that her cousin was panting while talking to her, an erotic one.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The news that Ochi relayed to her had her excited to seize this opportunity to be with her love and enjoy the intimacies that they would usually forgo, holding herself open for her lover to see. The lewd action had her blushing heavily  as her lover&#39;s fluids leaked out of her before Ochi brought her into another heady kiss, distracting her for a moment as she placed a soft hand on her love&#39;s cheek. Ochi&#39;s hands on her body rose goosebumps on her skin where scales didn&#39;t cover, the words making her shudder in anticipation.

&quot;I&#39;m yours, Ochi. You&#39;ll never need to share me. Indulge in me as you please.&quot;

The dominance and possessiveness had her feel a more submissive pose might help reaffirm her own words as she spread herself in presentation to her love, biting her lip a little. A soft hum comes from her lips as she feels the cock heads press against her holes once more, hearing the praises again as she slowly entered her again. 

&quot;Ochi... My love....&quot;

As she felt her love move faster with each thrust it stole the words from her as she gasped and moaned. Aniyah was ready for a longer session this time, eager for her lover&#39;s attention in every way.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The knight would answer her lover&#39;s moans with her own. She would draw a smirk on her face and start slapping her fianc&#233;e&#39;s ass gently, it wasn&#39;t something that she felt to do with Aniyah before, but the heat of the action made her more courageous to do so. This time the knight would notice that the sensibility on her fresh cock is becoming lower than the previous time, which made her feel more comfortable during her action, and the feeling of empty balls was quite enjoyable. But now that she has more time, she would not force the ride and make herself come quicker.

She would enjoy how her lover&#39;s words are getting cut with her hard fucking. Who needs words to express the enjoyment of the moment, only moans are sufficient. But if she started to hear her woman attempt to scream, she would slow herself down and even pause to see what the matter was. She would keep dipping her cock inside of the two holes while admiring the Yuan-ti ass. She would wonder what she could do to make things more enjoyable. She would reach to the woman&#39;s clit and start teasing it.

&quot;Tonight is heaven love.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The sudden slaps were new to her and caused a squeak of surprised to escape her in the moment, quickly deciding she enjoyed this side of Ochi as subsequent slaps drew louder moans from her. This more courageous side of her made her happy as she&#39;d been treating her much like a porcelain doll before, though now her body seemed to rather eagerly accept the hard fucking that Ochi was starting to show her.  With this it was hard for her to think let alone get the words out and to Ochi&#39;s ears.

Her moans grew louder as she settled in to the hard thrusts given to her by Ochi, enjoying each to the fullest as she glanced back at her love in the moment. As her lover hit certain spots within her she let out small screams and gasps of pleasure, reassuring her love she was fine and angling herself so Ochi could batter those spots more easily with each thrust. When Ochi started to tease her clit she settled into that happy pleasure high, only able to nod a confirmation of her lover&#39;s words between her moans.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Aniyah was always a porcelain doll that the knight wanted to protect with all her means. unlike other people who saw her as patchwork. She was always delicate and prudent when she dealt with her, but every time the woman surprised her day after day. Ochi never cared about other women&#39;s feelings, even with those that could bring her some diplomatic and strategic advantage. But when she sees that Shinouan Yuan-ti is coming into her life. She doesn&#39;t dare to hurt her, and protecting her becomes the mana that fuels her life again.

But tonight is not a normal night, it&#39;s one of the greatest nights that Aniyah will meet. This night was outside of the Yuan-ti mind when she planned for this trip, especially since her family&#39;s members seemed to be busy as well, but the goddess of knowledge and secrets knows everything, and simply watches her followers doing their life with a wide smile. That was going on the knight&#39;s mind for some seconds before the moan of her fianc&#233;e brought her back again. She would accelerate the rhythm once again, feeling her woman juices dripping.

&quot;Try to squeeze my cocks, you will feel even better&quot; She seized  her ass cheeks  and squeezed it.  

She would let a humming leaving her mouth escape some words from it &quot;Heav&#39;nly, illustrious, laughter-loving queen, sea-born, night-loving, of an awful mien; Crafty, from whom necessity first came, Producing, nightly, all-connecting dame: &#39;Tis thine the world with harmony to join, for all things spring from thee, O power divine.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Tonight felt different than most others as her lover treated her more roughly than usual, awakening a side of her she hadn&#39;t known about herself. Her moans filled the room and her fingers clawed at the sheets and blankets under her as she desperately looked for something to ground herself, Ochi driving into both of her needy holes at once and making her eyelids flutter under the barrage of pleasure. Hearing her love&#39;s suggestion she took to tightening the muscles that already sucked at the pair of her love&#39;s cocks, a gasping moan escaping her as it seemed the point clearly came across in what Ochi had said and what she felt. 

&quot;Ochi... You&#39;re amazing...ah!&quot;

The feeling of her thrusts pushing through the tightened muscles had to have felt good for Ochi as well and she glanced back at her lover for her reaction, hearing the prayer that left her lover&#39;s lips. It felt a little odd that she would love someone who was so devout, though it was a thought that was quickly thrust away as she&#39;d fallen in love with the woman, not her goddess. Her focus was on her love and their mutual pleasure even as she clutched at the blankets tightly, certain she would follow any order that Ochi might give her in this moment.

&quot;Teach me... how to truly please you, my love...&quot;

Ochi would catch the woman by her hips and start moving it toward her while raising the rhythm a little bit so she can match the squeezing power her lover is making around her organs. She would raise her head to the sky like a wolf getting ready to howl like a wolf, but she started Hissing happily. Hissing full of satisfaction. Tonight Ochi is feeling herself, being herself. She would put her noble manner behind her and enjoy herself like she never did before.

She noticed her lover&#39;s curiosity when spelled some word while facing her, she would  grin before starting explaining herself.
&quot;Don&#39;t mind my words I was simply thanking my goddess of love for our night” she would moan a little bit ‘ I summoned her to bless our  love&quot; then continued her words on her mind [internal speech: &quot;and why not bless us with a child with her holly power&quot;]

Indeed, Ochi wishes to have a child with Aniyah even if her lover can&#39;t bear a child, at the same time she works on a way to do it with her scholars that work for her house.  But she would probably bring this subject later.     

&quot;How to truly please me?&quot; She would ponder Aniyah&#39;s question while thrusting her lustful holes &quot;Just keep your holes tighter, and relax your body as much as you can.&quot;  The knight is enjoying her lover enthusiast.</span>

Her body squeezed around the intruding members desperately and she felt her lover&#39;s pace quickening, enjoying the more primal Ochi that she was being introduced to. The quick pace had her in an almost delirious state as she filled the room with her pleasured cries, blushing a bit with how Ochi explained her prayer mid-sex. 

It was an odd but not unwelcome feeling that came from the thought of being watched by her lover&#39;s goddess, unsure what caused the feeling to begin with. Deities never seemed to care what their people were actually doing or if they needed help, that was her own experiences with deities at least. Whatever the cause of it she was enjoying it to the fullest dispite the blush on her cheeks, never one to judge others for their belief in deities especially not Ochi.

&quot;Use me as you wish, my love. My body and heart are yours alone.&quot;
